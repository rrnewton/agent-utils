//! Every test here is written against a fake that **can say no**, and no two of them are the same

//! ever exercised in one shape would be a route that reports one cause confidently and five
//! causes wrongly, which is strictly worse than the "unavailable" it replaces.
//!
//! What is NOT established here: anything about live Discord or live ElevenLabs. The status codes
//! and the endpoint shapes come from the vendors' documentation, and the fakes were written from
//! the same reading — so the two agree with each other and not yet with the vendors.
