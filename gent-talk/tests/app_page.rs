//! Runs the phone web app's own test suite as part of `cargo test`.
//!
//! The twin of `tests/voice_page.rs`, and deliberately its twin rather than an extension of it:
//! `/` and `/voice` are two served pages with two suites and two floors, and a runner that pooled
//! them would let one suite stop collecting behind the other's count.
//!
//! It exists because the page at `/` had no suite at all while `/voice` had a large one, and that
//! asymmetry is exactly what let three fixes — `#52 operator-timezone`, `#62
//! message-count-accuracy` and `#39 channel-alias` — land on one page and not the other. A guard
//! over the bytes of both assets lives in `src/http/api.rs`; this is the behavioural half.
//!
//! `tests/js/app_page.test.mjs` executes `web/app.js` against a small strict DOM; see its header
//! for what that fixture can and cannot fake.
//!
//! # This does not skip
//!
//! If Node is missing, this FAILS, for the same reason `tests/voice_page.rs` does: a test that
//! turns itself off when a tool is absent reports green for a suite that never ran.
