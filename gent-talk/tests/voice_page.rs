//! Runs the `/voice` page's own test suite as part of `cargo test`.
//!
//! The page is plain browser JavaScript with no build step, so its behaviour cannot be asserted
//! from Rust directly — but it is also the surface the owner touches, and it had a real bug
//! (errors visible only in the dev console). A suite that only runs when somebody remembers to run
//! it is a suite that goes stale, so it hangs off the same `cargo test` everything else does.
//!
//! `tests/js/voice_page.test.mjs` executes `web/voice.js` against a small strict DOM; see its
//! header for what that fixture can and cannot fake.
//!
//! # This does not skip
//!
//! If Node is missing, this FAILS. A test that turns itself off when a tool is absent reports
//! green for a suite that never ran, and the page's error handling is exactly the kind of thing
//! that would then rot unnoticed.
