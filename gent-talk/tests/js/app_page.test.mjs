// Tests for the phone web app served at `/`, run against the REAL web/app.js and web/index.html.
//
// Why this exists at all: `/` and `/voice` are the two pages a person opens, they render the same
// facts about the same channels, and this repository has twice fixed one of them and shipped the
// other still wrong — `#52 operator-timezone` and `#62 message-count-accuracy` were both carried
// across afterwards, at the cost of a round trip each time. `#39 channel-alias` made it three:
// the alias reached /voice and the voice agent while this page went on printing the configured
// label, so one deployment showed two names for one channel.
//
// tests/js/voice_page.test.mjs has covered the other page for a long time. This file is the
// missing half, and it is built the same way and under the same rules:
//
//   * `getElementById` knows ONLY the ids that really appear in web/index.html, and THROWS for
//     anything else. A script reaching for an element the page does not have fails loudly here
//     instead of silently doing nothing on a phone.
//   * There is no innerHTML, no insertAdjacentHTML and no HTML parser anywhere in the fixture, so
//     a test cannot accidentally certify markup injection as "rendered". `page.createdTags`
//     records every element the page creates, which is how that is checked directly.
//   * A `<select>` moves to its first option when its options are replaced, exactly as a browser
//     does. That is not decoration: it is what makes "the picker is pointed at a channel" true
//     after a load, and a fixture without it would leave every read path unreachable.
//
// What this fixture CANNOT do: it lays nothing out, there is no speech engine, and there is no
// real network. It says what the page RENDERS, which is the whole of the claim being made here.
//
// No dependencies, no build step, no framework — same rule the page itself follows.
