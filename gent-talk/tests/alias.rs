//! `#39 channel-alias`: the operator's own name for a channel, end to end over the real router.
//!
//! Three claims are being pinned here, and they are the three the issue is about:
//!
//!   * **The alias wins wherever the configured label showed**, and clearing it puts the label
//!     back. Tested across every answer that carries a channel name, because a fix applied to the
//!     picker and not to the digest header is how the name the owner says and the name the model
//!     was given come apart — which is the entire point of the feature.
//!   * **The voice agent HEARS it.** `list_channels` and the digest header are read of local
//!     state on the way out; nothing about that is a write to Discord.
//!   * **The agent cannot CHOOSE it.** Not because of the scope — a hosted agent is routinely
//!     given the write token, since `post_reply` is a write tool — but because no tool for it
//!     exists. That is asserted against the tool manifest, at both scopes, and against `dispatch`.
//!
//! And one claim that is about what does NOT happen: nothing here reaches Discord. The fake
//! records every call made to it, so "Discord was never told" is checked rather than asserted.
