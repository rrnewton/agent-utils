"""Drive the REAL voice agent, headless, and prove it actually called this server.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============

scripts/verify-deployment.sh checks that this server is reachable and correct. On 2026-08-19 the
owner's session failed while every one of those checks passed. The access log shows the whole
handshake succeeding --

    mcp initialize 200 . notifications/initialized 202 . tools/list 200

-- and then ZERO tool calls. The agent said "the tools are showing as out of date" and never
invoked anything. Nothing we ran asserted that a tool is actually CALLED, so nothing went red.

This script closes exactly that gap. It holds a real conversation with the deployed agent and
fails unless a tool invocation appears in THIS SERVER'S OWN access log during the run.

IT COSTS VENDOR MINUTES. It is opt-in, manual, and is not part of any suite. Run it when you want
to see what the owner sees.

HOW IT DRIVES THE CONVERSATION WITHOUT A MICROPHONE
===================================================

ElevenLabs documents a client-to-server event that makes this fully headless:

    {"type": "user_message", "text": "..."}

"triggers the same response flow as spoken user input"
-- https://elevenlabs.io/docs/eleven-agents/customization/events/client-to-server-events

So the test types instead of speaking. Everything else on the wire is byte-identical to what
web/voice.js does in the owner's browser: mint a signed URL from OUR /api/v1/signed-url, open the
WebSocket, send a bare `conversation_initiation_client_data`, answer `ping` with `pong`. The
initiation payload is deliberately BARE rather than carrying a text-only override, because an
override only takes effect if it has been enabled in the agent's security settings, and a
conversation begun differently from the owner's is not the conversation this is meant to observe.
Audio frames are simply ignored.

THE TWO ASSERTIONS
==================

1. THE MECHANISM (primary). A tool line -- digest_channel, read_message or find_message -- must
   appear in this server's access log during the run. This is the direct check for the failure
   above, and it does not depend on interpreting a word of the agent's prose. It is also
   unforgeable from our side: access::tool_call fires ONLY on the MCP path (src/mcp/protocol.rs),
   so nothing this script does over the REST API can plant one.

2. THE OUTCOME (corroboration). A fluent reply about nothing is the failure mode of a confabulating
   agent -- this one has invented a whole channel digest before. So rather than asking for a
   summary, which can only be judged by eye, this asks the agent to RELAY THE MOST RECENT MESSAGE
   AND ITS TIMESTAMP, which is comparable by string. We fetch that message from our own API first
   and assert the reply carries it back.

   THE CHEAP ROUND IS PROOF, not merely confidence, and the argument is structural rather than
   probabilistic. Nothing lets the agent produce today's latest message without invoking a tool:
   the test opens a FRESH conversation, so there is no prior history to draw on; the channel's
   recent content POSTDATES any training data; and every message in it is from the owner, from an
   agent of his, or from the bot, none of which is in the model's context at turn one. So a green
   run means something on its own -- no second conversation, no writing to the channel.

   THE TOKEN ROUND IS AN AUTOMATIC ESCALATION ON FAILURE, not a mode anyone has to choose. It
   exists to diagnose a false NEGATIVE, which is the error that IS possible here: when the cheap
   round fails, either the agent is not really reading, or it read fine and this script's
   substring matching was too strict. Those have OPPOSITE fixes. So a failing cheap round posts a
   `gtverify-<epoch>-<random>` token through OUR OWN write API -- never through the agent -- and
   asks again, requiring it back verbatim. The two outcomes are reported as different things:

     cheap fails, token PASSES  ->  THE TEST is wrong (exit 18). Fix check_relay(), not the agent.
     cheap fails, token FAILS   ->  THE AGENT is not reading (exit 14), now proven.

   A failing run therefore costs roughly twice the vendor minutes of a passing one. That is the
   price of not sending the next session after the wrong system. --nonce forces the token round
   directly, for when you want that evidence on a run that would otherwise pass cheaply.

   AND SOME RUNS ARE REFUSED RATHER THAN DECIDED. If the channel is empty, or its newest message
   has nothing distinctive to match on, the grounding assertion would pass or fail purely on how
   it happens to be written. That is a green that means nothing, or a red that means nothing. Such
   a run stops BEFORE any conversation is opened, with exit 20 -- neither a pass nor a fail --
   and nothing is billed.

   THAT ESCALATION HAS ALREADY FIRED ONCE, on 2026-08-19, and it was right: the agent was reading
   and this script was wrong. It is a VOICE agent, so it SPEAKS the timestamp -- "thirteen
   fifty-one Eastern Time on August nineteenth, two thousand twenty-six" -- and a digit-only
   matcher rejects that. The matcher now accepts spoken numerals and a time rendered in any real
   zone; what it did NOT do is stop requiring a timestamp, because that is the half that forces
   the reply to commit to WHICH message it is relaying. See RelayVerdict.grounded for the argument
   and check_spoken_timestamp_controls() for the controls that keep the leniency honest.

   Each assertion ships with its controls, run every time (--self-test runs them alone, offline):
   the log scanner must find a real captured tool line and must NOT fire on a handshake-only log,
   the relay check must reject a fluent confabulated reply AND a different time spoken in the same
   style, and a FAILED run must return the exit code documented below rather than 0.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
===================

It never asks the agent to post. Summarising and relaying are read-only. If the agent's tool calls
arrive with the WRITE credential -- which the access log records -- post_reply was reachable, and
that is reported as a finding.

USAGE
=====

    scripts/smoke-agent.py --url URL --channel SNOWFLAKE [--nonce] [--container NAME] ...

Tokens come from $GENT_TALK_READ_TOKEN / $GENT_TALK_WRITE_TOKEN. They are never accepted on the
command line, because a command line is visible to every process on the box, and never printed.

    scripts/smoke-agent.py --self-test     offline; runs every control and costs nothing.

Normally you get here through the launcher, which already knows the URL, channel and container:

    scripts/run.sh --smoke-agent

EXIT CODES -- a failure says WHICH failure
==========================================

     0  passed
     2  usage or configuration error
    10  mint_failed          could not mint a signed URL from our own /api/v1/signed-url
    11  socket_refused       the conversation WebSocket would not open
    12  no_reply             connected, but no agent reply arrived within the timeout
    13  no_tool_call         the agent replied and called NO tool  <-- 2026-08-19's failure
    14  ungrounded           a tool was called, but the reply does not carry the message back --
                             and the token round did not either, so this is proven
    15  credential_leak      a credential appeared in this script's own output
    16  baseline_failed      could not read the channel ourselves, so grounding is undecidable
    17  control_failed       an assertion's own control failed: the check cannot be trusted
    18  relay_check_too_strict  the agent IS reading -- the token came back -- but this script's
                             matching rejected the cheap round. The defect is HERE, not there.
    20  channel_unusable     REFUSED, neither pass nor fail: the channel is empty or has nothing
                             distinctive to match on, so no run could have concluded anything.
                             No conversation was opened and nothing was billed.

        # -- 1. the cheap round: read the channel ourselves, then ask -----------------------------
        #
        # THE CHEAP ROUND IS PROOF, NOT MERELY CONFIDENCE, and the reason is structural rather
        # than probabilistic. There is no path by which the agent produces today's latest message
        # without invoking a tool:
        #
        #   * this opens a FRESH conversation, so there is no prior history to draw on;
        #   * the channel's recent content POSTDATES any training data;
        #   * every message in it is from the owner, from an agent of his, or from the bot -- none
        #     of which is in the model's context at turn one.
        #
        # Do not re-weaken this into a hedge. It matters because it is what makes a green run mean
        # something on its own, without spending a second conversation to confirm it.
        #
        # The escalation ladder, because getting it wrong costs the owner money:
        #
        #   cheap passes             -> done. One conversation, nothing written to the channel.
        #   cheap fails on GROUNDING -> escalate to a token round. NOT to rule out a false
        #                               POSITIVE -- those are impossible, per the argument above --
        #                               but to diagnose a false NEGATIVE: if the agent really did
        #                               read the channel and our substring matcher was simply too
        #                               strict, the token separates "the agent is not reading" from
        #                               "our check is wrong". That is a question about the quality
        #                               of THIS SCRIPT, not about the agent's honesty, and the two
        #                               have opposite fixes.
        #   cheap fails on the TOOL CALL -> STOP. No escalation (see hold_round): an agent that
        #                               invoked nothing cannot read a token either, so a second
        #                               billed conversation would buy no information.
