# Verify a running gent-talk deployment end to end, over the MCP endpoint an ElevenLabs agent
# will actually use.
#
# Run this twice: once against http://127.0.0.1:8080 right after `podman run` (step 3 of
# QUICKSTART.md), and again against the public tunnel hostname once cloudflared is up (step 4).
# The same checks apply to both, which is the point: if the tunnel changed anything, the second
# run says so.
#
# It exits non-zero on the FIRST failure and names the check that failed. There is no partial
# success and no check that can silently no-op: every check either prints "ok" with what it saw,
# or stops the script.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/verify-deployment.sh --url URL --channel SNOWFLAKE \
#       [--read-token T] [--write-token T] [--skip-post]
#
# Tokens default to $GENT_TALK_READ_TOKEN / $GENT_TALK_WRITE_TOKEN, so the same environment that
# started the container can drive the check.
#
# --skip-post drops the two checks that put a real message in a real channel. Use it when you are
# pointed at a channel you would rather not write to; understand that you are then NOT testing the
# half of the system that speaks in your name.
