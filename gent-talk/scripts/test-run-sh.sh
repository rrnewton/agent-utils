# HOME, XDG_RUNTIME_DIR and DBUS stay REAL on purpose: rootless podman and `systemctl --user`
# resolve their state through them. In particular, pointing XDG_CONFIG_HOME at a temp directory
# makes podman read a different, empty configuration and report ZERO running containers without
# any error — which would turn the already-running checks below into silent false passes. Tests
# that must not see the real ~/.config/gent-talk/env therefore either pass --config (which
# replaces the file layer) or use run_sh_isolated_config, which does not need podman.
#
# That trap is why the tunnel-from-user-config checks below assert on run.sh's OWN error text
# rather than on anything podman reports.
#
# ENGINE_FOR_RUN lets a check hand run.sh a wrapper around podman (see FAKE_ENGINE below); it
# defaults to the real engine. The `timeout` is not decoration: a --logs or --follow that waits
# on a container that is not there would otherwise wedge the whole suite instead of failing, and
