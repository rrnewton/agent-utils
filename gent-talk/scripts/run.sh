# Build and run the gent-talk container, with the checks that make a bad start fail HERE instead
# of five minutes later inside a container that came up and quietly does not work.
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. Refuses to run if a gent-talk container is already up (see --shutdown / --restart).
#   2. Loads configuration and verifies every REQUIRED variable is actually set, by name.
#   3. Optionally (off by default) makes sure the cloudflared tunnel unit is running.
#   4. Rebuilds the image.
#   5. Removes a leftover STOPPED container, proves the host directory for durable state is
#      writable by the container's own user, then runs the new one detached with it mounted.
#
# DURABLE STATE. The server keeps the /voice transcript, its own read marks and its summary cache
# in a SQLite file. That file must live OUTSIDE the container: this script replaces the container
# on every launch, so anything written into the image's writable layer is destroyed by the next
# deploy, silently. GENT_TALK_DATA_DIR (default: ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/gent-talk)
# is created 0700 and mounted at /var/lib/gent-talk. --status reports it. Deleting that directory
# is the purge.
#
# The mount also has to be WRITABLE BY THE CONTAINER'S USER, which is not automatic and is not
# what a bind mount gives you: the image runs as uid 10001, and under rootless podman a directory
# owned by the invoking user appears inside the container as root's. Step 5 therefore maps the
# container's server user back onto this one (--userns=keep-id) and then PROVES the mount is
# writable, with the real image, before launching anything. The server refuses to start when it
# cannot open its store, so without that check a bad mount is a crash loop discovered from logs.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/run.sh [--shutdown] [--restart] [--logs] [--follow] [--status] [--tunnel-status]
#                  [--smoke-agent [--nonce] [--replay-check]]
#                  [--screenshots [--out DIR] [--theme THEME]]
#                  [--config FILE] [--tunnel|--no-tunnel] [--tag TAG] [--port PORT]
#                  [--restart-policy POLICY] [--dry-run] [--help]
#
# Flags, one action per invocation:
#   --shutdown     Stop the running gent-talk container and EXIT (it does not go on to rebuild or
#                  relaunch). Use --restart for stop-then-relaunch. Stopping KEEPS the container
#                  and its logs; see --logs.
#   --restart      Stop the running gent-talk container, then continue with rebuild and relaunch.
#   --logs         Print the container's output SO FAR and exit — a one-shot dump. Works on a
#                  stopped container too, which is the whole point of not using --rm.
#   --follow       Stream the container's output live until you interrupt it (Ctrl-C). This is
#                  the "attach" action: a terminal tab running it follows the server exactly as
#                  though you had started the container in the foreground yourself. Nothing is
#                  stopped when you interrupt it; you are only reading.
#   --status       Report what is running, plus config, container name, restart policy, whether
#                  logs are being retained, where durable state is mounted from, and tunnel state;
#                  then exit.
#   --tunnel-status  Report the cloudflared tunnel user unit: whether it is active, since when,
#                  whether it is enabled at boot, and the hostname it serves. STRICTLY READ-ONLY
#                  — it never starts, stops, or enables anything. Exits 0 when the unit is
#                  active, 1 when it is not.
#   --smoke-agent  *** COSTS VENDOR MINUTES. MANUAL ONLY. *** Hold a REAL conversation with the
#                  deployed ElevenLabs voice agent, headless (typed, not spoken), and fail unless
#                  the agent actually CALLED A TOOL on this server during it. This is the check
#                  every other check here cannot make: on 2026-08-19 the owner's session failed
#                  while every server-side check passed, because the agent completed the MCP
#                  handshake and then invoked nothing. Nothing asserted that a tool is called, so
#                  nothing went red.
#                  It is deliberately NOT part of any suite and NOT run by CI: each run opens a
#                  billed conversation. Run it when you want to see what the owner sees. It reads
#                  the channel and never asks the agent to post. The container is only READ from
#                  (its log); nothing is started, stopped, or rebuilt.
#                  Needs the python3 'websockets' package; it says so by name if it is missing.
#
#                  WHAT A RUN COSTS. A PASSING run is ONE short conversation (about 15 seconds of
#                  socket time) and writes NOTHING to the channel. A FAILING run costs roughly
#                  TWICE that: when the agent's reply does not carry the channel message back, the
#                  test automatically escalates — it posts one unique token to the channel through
#                  this server's own write API (never through the agent) and asks again, requiring
#                  the token back verbatim. That second conversation is what separates "the agent
#                  is not really reading" from "the test's own matching was too strict", which are
#                  different problems with opposite fixes. The two are reported as different
#                  results, never as one "smoke failed".
#                  Some runs are REFUSED rather than decided: an empty channel, or a newest message
#                  with nothing distinctive in it, cannot decide the question either way, so the
#                  run stops before opening any conversation and bills nothing.
#   --replay-check Only with --smoke-agent. *** COSTS THREE CONVERSATIONS. *** Asks a DIFFERENT
#                  question from the ordinary run: does the vendor actually act on a replayed
#                  transcript (#46 conversation-replay)? Conversation A states a nonce and its
#                  turns are recorded through this server's own transcript API, exactly as the
#                  /voice page records them; conversation B opens WITH that record and must return
#                  the nonce; conversation C is the CONTROL — same question, no record — and must
#                  NOT be able to answer. Without C the run would prove the agent is fluent rather
#                  than that it remembers, so all three are reported separately.
#                  Refused, billing nothing, when this server has no durable store; refused after
#                  ONE conversation when replay.enabled is false or the transcript came back
#                  empty, because the transcript has to exist before it can be asked for.
#                  "The vendor did not honour it" is a distinct exit code (21), not a generic
#                  failure: it is the single most useful thing this check can tell you, and until
#                  it comes back green the interface must not claim a call was resumed.
#   --nonce        Only with --smoke-agent. Go straight to the token round instead of waiting for
#                  the cheap check to fail — for when you want that evidence on a run that would
#                  otherwise pass cheaply, or when the channel's latest message is too plain to
#                  match on. It always writes one line to the channel. You do not need this to get
#                  the escalation: that happens by itself when the cheap check fails.
#   --screenshots  Photograph the /voice page in all thirty-one states that look different, so an
#                  agent can LOOK at the interface before the owner does. FREE and offline: no vendor
#                  conversation, no microphone, no money. The conversation WebSocket is replaced by
#                  a fake and the microphone is Chromium's built-in fake capture device, so the
#                  live-call, muted and post-call states are reached without ElevenLabs ever being
#                  contacted.
#
#                  Why it exists: the /voice page's own suite drives the real script and asserts
#                  that the right properties sit on the right selectors, but it lays NOTHING out,
#                  so it cannot tell you the page looks right. One photograph of a phone showed
#                  three defects the whole suite had passed over. This is the check that can see.
#
#                  It starts its OWN throwaway server, native (not a container), with
#                  --fake-discord, on port 18091 by default — never 8080, and it refuses to use it.
#                  It never touches the running gent-talk, or its config, or its logs. The server
#                  is stopped again when the run ends, including on failure.
#
#                  Each capture is checked: the expected state must actually be on screen before
#                  the shutter opens, and the resulting image must not be blank or a single flat
#                  colour. A state that cannot be reached FAILS BY NAME rather than being
#                  photographed approximately.
#
#                  It is opt-in and is in no suite. Needs the python3 'playwright' package and its
#                  Chromium; it says so by name, with the install command, if either is missing.
#                  It rebuilds the binary first, because web/ is compiled INTO it — without that
#                  you photograph the last build's markup and believe it is today's.
#   --out DIR      Only with --screenshots. Where to write the PNGs (default: a timestamped
#                  directory under gent-talk/debug/screenshots/, which is gitignored). Screenshots
#                  are evidence, never source, and are never committed.
#   --theme THEME  Only with --screenshots. dark (the default), light, or both. DARK IS THE
#                  DEFAULT DELIBERATELY: the owner's phone is dark, and the first run of this
#                  harness captured nothing but light frames because that is the browser
#                  automation default — so the whole set reviewed a page he never sees. Contrast
#                  between the two speakers is exactly what does not survive the swap, so the
#                  theme that counts is the one captured by default.
#   --config FILE  Use exactly this configuration file and no other. Missing file is an error.
#   --tunnel       Force the cloudflared tunnel check ON for this run.
#   --no-tunnel    Force the cloudflared tunnel check OFF for this run.
#   --tag TAG      Image tag to build and run (default: v0, or $GENT_TALK_IMAGE_TAG).
#   --port PORT    Host port to publish on (default: 8080, or $GENT_TALK_HOST_PORT).
#   --restart-policy POLICY
#                  Restart policy for the launched container (default: on-failure:5, or
#                  $GENT_TALK_RESTART_POLICY). See the discussion below before changing it.
#   --dry-run      Run every check and print the build/run commands, but build and start nothing.
#   --help         This text.
#
# How the container is run, and why:
#   Detached (-d), under a FIXED name (default: the image name, so 'gent-talk'), and WITHOUT
#   --rm. Each of those is deliberate:
#     * -d          it does not die with the terminal that launched it. Follow it with --follow.
#     * fixed name  'podman logs gent-talk' works for a human without looking anything up.
#     * no --rm     the container survives stopping, so 'podman logs' still has the per-request
#                   access log AFTER a crash — which is exactly when you want to read it. With
#                   --rm the log was destroyed by the very event you were investigating.
#   The retention guarantee, stated exactly: logs survive stopping, and are discarded at the
#   NEXT launch, when the old container is removed to make room. So look before you relaunch.
#   A leftover stopped container is removed automatically just before the relaunch, so a stale
#   one never collides with the fixed name and you never have to clean up by hand.
#
#   Detection of "is it already running?" still matches on IMAGE REFERENCE and PUBLISHED HOST
#   PORT, never on the container name. The fixed name is a convenience for humans; depending on
#   it would break the moment someone launched a container by hand, and would regress the
#   equal-length matching bug fixed in running_containers() below.
#
# Restart policy: pick it deliberately. RECOMMENDED: on-failure:5 (the default).
#   on-failure:5   Restart after a crash, at most 5 times, then stay down. A one-off crash
#                  self-heals; a crash LOOP stops and stays visibly down instead of hiding
#                  behind an endless restart, which is how an outage becomes invisible. The
#                  logs of the last attempt are still there to read.
#   always         Restart forever, including after a clean exit. Choose this only if you would
#                  rather be up-with-broken-requests than down, and you are watching --logs.
#   no             Never restart. A crash stays exactly where it fell. Most visible, least
#                  available; a fine choice while debugging.
#   unless-stopped On PODMAN this is IDENTICAL to 'always' (podman-run(1) says so) — it is NOT
#                  the docker behaviour some expect.
#   Surviving a REBOOT is a separate switch, and no policy value alone provides it: podman only
#   restarts containers across a reboot via podman-restart.service, which starts containers
#   whose policy is literally 'always'. To get reboot survival:
#     systemctl --user enable --now podman-restart.service   # and: loginctl enable-linger $USER
#   and run with --restart-policy always. Until you do that, the tunnel unit comes back after a
#   reboot and gent-talk does not — which --tunnel-status and --status will show you.
#
# Configuration precedence, HIGHEST first:
#   1. Variables already exported in your shell environment. These always win.
#   2. --config FILE, if given. When passed, no other file is read.
#   3. ~/.config/gent-talk/env         — per-user base, shared by every checkout on this machine.
# There is exactly ONE default configuration file, so there is never a question of which copy is
# live. Copy gent-talk/gent-talk.env.example to it to get started; it documents every variable.
#
# This script never prints the value of a credential. It reports variables by NAME only.
