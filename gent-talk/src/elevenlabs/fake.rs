//! An in-memory ElevenLabs stand-in for tests and for local development.
//!
//! # It must be able to say no
//!
//! The same design note as [`crate::discord::fake`], for the same reason. A fake that answers
//! every mint with a plausible `wss://` URL cannot fail, so a test written against it would be
//! self-certifying: green here and worth nothing about the real client. This one therefore holds
//! the two things a real ElevenLabs account holds — **the API key it will accept**, and **the
//! agent ids it actually has** — and refuses anything else the way ElevenLabs refuses it: HTTP
//! 401 for a bad key, HTTP 404 for an agent that is not on the account.
//!
//! It also shares the real client's code for the two things that could otherwise drift: it builds
//! its request through [`super::http::signed_url_request`], and it goes through
//! [`super::credentials`] first, so a server with no key configured fails here exactly as it fails
//! in production — before any call is attempted, naming the setting.
