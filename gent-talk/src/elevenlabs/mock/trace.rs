//! An append-only, credential-redacted record of everything the mock did.
//!
//! # Why a trace and not just assertions on the socket
//!
//! Half of what this mock exists to prove is a NEGATIVE: that the agent never called `/mcp`, that
//! no PCM was uploaded, that the account key never reached a URL. A negative cannot be asserted
//! from the socket, because the absence of a frame is indistinguishable from a frame that has not
//! arrived yet. The trace turns each of those into a positive statement about a finite list.
//!
//! # The redaction rule
//!
//! Every string that enters the trace goes through [`crate::elevenlabs::redact`] against every
//! registered secret — the account API key, the bridge bearer tokens, and each minted WebSocket
//! nonce (registered as it is minted, so the trace cannot be written before the secret is known).
//! Audio is recorded as a **length only**, never as base64: the same rule
//! [`crate::access`] already states for channel text, for the same reason — a trace is written to
//! a file and pasted into an issue.
