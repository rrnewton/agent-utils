//! Minting a short-lived signed conversation URL from ElevenLabs.
//!
//! Turning on "Enable Authentication" on an ElevenLabs agent closes the public `talk-to` link: a
//! conversation can only be started from a **signed URL**, which is minted from ElevenLabs' API
//! with an account API key and is good for a documented fifteen minutes. That key is an account
//! credential — it can spend money and read the account's agents — so it lives here, on the
//! server, and the only thing that ever crosses the wire to a caller is the minted URL.
//!
//! Three rules hold in this module, and the tests exist to hold them:
//!
//! * **The key never appears in an output.** It travels in a request *header*, never in a URL or
//!   a body, and every error built from a vendor response goes through [`redact`] first — because
//!   an upstream is free to echo a credential back in its own error text, and that text ends up
//!   in a log and in an API response.
//! * **A missing key is a loud, specific failure.** There is no unsigned fallback: an agent with
//!   authentication enabled would simply refuse the connection later, in the browser, where the
//!   operator cannot see why.
//! * **The failure modes are distinguishable.** "You never configured a key", "ElevenLabs
//!   rejected the key", and "ElevenLabs is unreachable" are three different errors with three
//!   different HTTP statuses, because they have three different fixes.
