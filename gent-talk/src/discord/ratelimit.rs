//! Discord's rate limiter, read and respected.
//!
//! Discord answers an over-quota request with **HTTP 429** and tells you, precisely, how long to
//! wait. Ignoring that and surfacing the 429 as a gateway error is not "no rate limiting" — it is
//! rate limiting done badly, because the caller then retries by hand at whatever rate it feels
//! like and the next request is rejected too. This module is the part that listens.
//!
//! # What Discord actually sends
//!
//! Two independent channels say the same thing, and they disagree in a way that matters:
//!
//! * the **body**, `{"message": "You are being rate limited.", "retry_after": 0.529, "global":
//!   false}` — `retry_after` is in **seconds, as a float**; and
//! * the **`Retry-After` header**, in seconds, ROUNDED — historically to a whole second, and not
//!   always upwards.
//!
//! The body is therefore preferred and the header is the fallback: retrying a few milliseconds
//! early costs another rejected request, which is the exact thing being avoided.
//!
//! Three further headers are read where present:
//!
//! * `X-RateLimit-Bucket` — Discord's own opaque hash for the bucket this route belongs to. Two
//!   routes can share one bucket, and only Discord knows which; learning the hash is what lets a
//!   limit observed on one route apply to the other.
//! * `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and `X-RateLimit-Reset-After` — how many requests are left in the
//!   current window and how long until it refills. `remaining: 0` on a **successful** response is
//!   advance warning: the next request on that bucket is going to be a 429, and [`RateLimiter`]
//!   waits it out instead of spending it.
//! * `X-RateLimit-Scope` / `X-RateLimit-Global` — whether the limit is the **whole bot token** or
//!   one route's bucket.
//!
//! # Global is not the same as per-route, and is not treated as if it were
//!
//! A per-route 429 stops one route. A **global** 429 stops every request this token makes, so
//! [`RateLimiter`] holds a separate whole-token gate and every route waits behind it. Filing a
//! global limit under the route that happened to observe it would let the very next request, on a
//! different channel, walk straight into the same wall.
//!
//! # The budget is bounded, and running out is LOUD
//!
//! Waiting is bounded twice — [`RetryPolicy::max_attempts`] and [`RetryPolicy::max_total_wait`] —
//! because a request that waits as long as Discord asks, however long that is, is a request that
//! can hang until the caller gives up with nothing to say. When either bound is reached the call
//! fails with [`super::DiscordError::RateLimited`], which names the rate limit, the route, how
//! many attempts were made, how long was actually spent waiting and what Discord last asked for.
//! It is never downgraded to an empty result.
//!
//! **This is bounded waiting, not a queue.** Nothing is stored and retried later; a request that
//! exhausts the budget is over, and its caller decides what to do next.
//!
//! # One notion of "slow down", not two
//!
//! [`crate::live`]'s poll loop also slows down after a failure, by doubling its interval. The two
//! are not rivals, because they nest: this module is the inner, precise wait that Discord itself
//! asked for, and the poll loop only ever sees a rate limit that this module could not clear
//! inside its budget. When that happens the poll loop waits at least as long as Discord's own
//! outstanding `retry_after` — see [`super::DiscordError::retry_after`] — so the outer backoff can
//! be longer than Discord asked for but never shorter.
//!
//! # Tested against a fake, and only against a fake
//!
//! Everything here is exercised by [`super::fake::FakeDiscord`], which shares this engine, and by
//! unit tests over the parsing. **None of it has met live Discord**, so the header names, the body
//! field and the rounding behaviour come from Discord's published documentation rather than from
//! observation.
