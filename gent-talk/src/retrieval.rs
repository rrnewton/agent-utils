//! Semantic random access: "read me the full message about the mac runner".
//!
//! This is the capability the whole project exists for. A phone screen lets you scroll; speech
//! does not, so the way to reach one message out of forty while driving is to describe it and get
//! it back in full. The API shape is therefore: a digest to hear what is there, and a *resolve*
//! call that turns a spoken description into one specific message.
//!
//! The v0 ranker is lexical — inverse document frequency over the fetched window, plus a phrase
//! bonus and a recency tiebreak. It is naive on purpose and it is behind [`Ranker`], so an
//! embedding-based implementation can replace it without touching the API, the handlers, or the
//! voice agent's tool definitions.
//!
//! Two behaviours matter more than the scoring formula, and both are tested:
//!
//! * a query that matches nothing returns NOTHING, rather than the most recent message wearing a
//!   confident label; and
//! * scoring rewards the rarer term, so "mac runner" beats a message that merely says "deploy"
//!   for the fifth time.
