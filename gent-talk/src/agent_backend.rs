//! The slow path: asking a coding agent for more detail than the channel contains.
//!
//! Scope note. This is a SEAM, not a feature. v0 defines the interface, wires an implementation
//! that is honest about being absent, and stops there. The endpoint exists so the voice agent's
//! tool list is stable, and so the day this is built no API shape has to change.
//!
//! The reason it is only a seam: reaching a coding agent means reaching into a developer machine,
//! and that is a much larger security decision than reading a Discord channel. This server is
//! deliberately not co-located with the coding agents and needs no access to their workspaces. Any
//! implementation must keep that property — it should post a question into the channel the agents
//! already watch, or talk to a narrow broker, and never gain a shell on a workstation.
