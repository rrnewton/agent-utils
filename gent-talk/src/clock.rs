//! Saying an instant out loud, in the operator's own zone.
//!
//! Discord hands this server ISO-8601 in UTC — `2026-08-19T13:51:25.123000+00:00`. That is a fine
//! value to compute with and a terrible one to read aloud, because the reader has to convert it
//! and then label the result. In a live run the assistant was given 13:51:25 UTC and said
//! "thirteen fifty-one Eastern Time": it kept the digits and attached a zone that did not belong
//! to them. Nine fifty-one was the answer.
//!
//! So the conversion happens HERE, once, and what travels onward is a string that is already
//! correct when spoken verbatim. The exact instant travels alongside it, unrounded, because
//! rounding to the second would lose ordering information and because anything that computes with
//! a time needs the real one. See [`crate::model::Message::spoken_time`] for the naming rule that
//! keeps the two apart.
//!
//! # The zone database is bundled
//!
//! `jiff` is depended on with `tzdb-bundle-always`, so the IANA database is compiled into the
//! binary. The runtime stage of `Containerfile` is `debian:bookworm-slim` with nothing but
//! `ca-certificates` installed — no `tzdata` — and a server that silently fell back to UTC because
//! the image lacked a database would reproduce the exact bug this module exists to fix.
