//! Reconstructing continuity across a hang-up.
//!
//! The vendor documents no way to resume a conversation once the socket closes, and until now the
//! interface said so plainly: the agent starts fresh. That is honest, but it is a limitation
//! rather than a requirement — this server holds the transcript ([`crate::store`]), so the EFFECT
//! can be rebuilt from our side by handing the earlier exchange to the new conversation as text.
//!
//! # This is a reconstruction, and it must never be allowed to read as more than one
//!
//! Everything here is arranged around one failure: an interface that claims continuity it does not
//! have. A resumed call is a NEW conversation that has been told what was said. It can be
//! disabled, it can be partial, and it can fail — and those are three visibly different states on
//! screen, not one green light. [`Replay::dropped`] and [`Replay::included`] exist so a caller can
//! tell them apart without guessing, and an empty transcript deliberately produces an empty
//! [`Replay::text`]: a "you are resuming" preamble with no record behind it is exactly the false
//! claim this module exists to prevent, so the caller sends NOTHING.
//!
//! # The transcript is untrusted text
//!
//! A stored turn is the owner's own speech AND whatever channel text the agent read aloud to him —
//! which is third-party Discord text that has been through a speech synthesiser and back into a
//! record. It is precisely what [`crate::untrusted`] exists for, so every turn is neutralized and
//! the whole record is fenced. [`PREAMBLE`] sits OUTSIDE the fence, because it is this server
//! speaking and the point of the fence is that nothing inside it is.
//!
//! # The budget is a guess until it is measured
//!
//! A transcript grows without bound; the payload is billed per call and the model's window is
//! finite. The rule is stated rather than discovered: keep the MOST RECENT turns until either
//! budget is exhausted, drop oldest first, and report how many were dropped. Whether 6000
//! characters is the right number is not something this crate can know — see
//! `scripts/smoke-agent.py --replay-check`, which is the only thing that can answer it.
