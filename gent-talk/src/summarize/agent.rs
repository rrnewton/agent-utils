//! A summariser backed by the ElevenLabs conversational agent, over a POOLED text-only socket.
//!
//! # The thing that makes this different from an HTTP client
//!
//! A ConvAI socket is a **conversation**, not a request channel. Everything sent down one stays in
//! the agent's context, including the agent's own previous answers. Summarising twenty messages
//! down one socket therefore makes each summary an input to the next: the context grows without
//! bound, the token cost grows with it, and by the tenth summary the agent is answering about
//! message ten while looking at nine summaries of other people's messages. There is no event that
//! resets conversation history, so the only way to get a clean context is a new socket.
//!
//! The opposite extreme is a socket per summary, which is correct and wasteful: every summary then
//! pays a mint, a TLS handshake, a WebSocket upgrade and an initiation round trip before the
//! question is even asked, and ElevenLabs bills connection time as well as tokens.
//!
//! So: **one pooled conversation, recycled every [`DEFAULT_MAX_PER_SOCKET`] summaries and closed
//! after [`DEFAULT_SOCKET_IDLE_SECONDS`] of quiet.** Both numbers are configuration, and both are
//! folded into the cache key, because both change what a summary says.
//!
//! # Why eight
//!
//! Counting in prompt-equivalents — one prompt being the instruction plus one message plus its
//! context window — the k-th summary on a shared socket carries roughly `k` of them, so a socket
//! that serves `N` summaries costs about `N(N+1)/2` where `N` separate sockets would cost `N`.
//! At `N = 8` that is 36 prompt-equivalents for 8 summaries, and the handshake is paid once
//! instead of eight times. At `N = 32` it is 528 for 32, and the quadratic term has comfortably
//! overtaken the handshake it was meant to amortise. Eight is also about as many messages as one
//! person reads through in a sitting before the pause exceeds the idle timeout and the socket is
//! closed anyway, so in practice the recycle limit is the *backstop* and the idle timeout is what
//! usually retires a conversation.
//!
//! None of this is measured against ElevenLabs, because nothing here has met ElevenLabs. It is an
//! argument from the shape of the protocol, and it is configuration precisely so a deployment that
//! measures something different can disagree.
//!
//! # Plain text, and why the instruction is not the whole answer
//!
//! The summary is rendered with `textContent` and read aloud, so a markdown bullet is not
//! formatting there — it is an asterisk on the screen and a word in the ear. [`PLAIN_TEXT_RULE`]
//! asks the model for plain text, and [`plain`] flattens what comes back, because an instruction
//! is a request and a model is free to decline it.
