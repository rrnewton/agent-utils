"""Python-vs-Rust differential tester for dagrun.

Prove the Python and Rust builds produce identical OBSERVABLE behavior. For a set of
representative and randomized DAG fixtures, this runs BOTH the Python CLI (``python3 -m dagrun``)
and a private copy of the executable resolved by the tracked ``rs/bin`` Cargo launcher and
asserts:

* ``list``, ``ascii``, ``dot`` stdout are BYTE-IDENTICAL.
* ``json`` stdout is BYTE-IDENTICAL (both builds emit ``ensure_ascii=False`` canonical JSON, so
  the bytes match for every input — including multi-line / quote / backslash / control-char /
  unicode ``description`` fields, and floats in scientific notation).
* Every ``.yaml`` fixture is ISOMORPHIC to JSON: loaded in BOTH builds and re-emitted as
  canonical JSON, the bytes match; and each ``examples/NAME.{json,yaml}`` pair loads to the same
  DAG.
* Scalar-resolution PARITY: a battery of adversarial scalars (the YAML "Norway problem",
  octal/underscore/sexagesimal/timestamp tokens, non-finite and overflow floats, and
  out-of-i64-range integers) is loaded in BOTH builds and must yield the SAME accept/reject exit
  code — and byte-identical JSON whenever both accept. This catches PyYAML-1.1-vs-serde_norway-1.2
  and Python-json-vs-serde_json divergences that the isomorphism check (which only covers
  documents both builds accept) cannot.
* ``run`` agrees on exit code, and on the passed/failed/aborted/intentionally-skipped/
  dependency-skipped/not-launched counts. Counts are
  compared under ``--keep-going`` so they are deterministic (the default eager-exit path
  races on which in-flight step is cancelled first, so only its exit code is compared).
* ``--selected`` selection agrees: a named leaf brings in its full dependency ancestry, while
  ``--ignore-selected-deps`` runs only the named node. Both builds match on exit code and counts,
  and reject an unknown selected tag or the dependency-ignoring flag without a selection.
  A successful ``sweep`` must produce the same width rows and table schema; measured timing cells
  and the ``--profile`` table are not byte-compared because runtimes legitimately differ.
* The memory-aware ``--max-steps`` decision and modeled footprint from ``--max-mem`` match,
  including effective-width scaling, hard/default/engine-only runnable steps, prompt refusal when
  even one step cannot fit, CPA infeasibility driven by learned RSS, and signed-64 saturation.
* ``run`` keeps active-step fan-out (``-s``) independent from its total CPU budget
  (``-j`` / ``--max-cpus``): the same fork-based guest workload records normalized step/worker
  overlap under both engines, including two full-width steps whose aggregate live workers exceed
  the budget while each individual width remains bounded. A declared over-budget self-managed
  width is refused before spawn, and profile-derived recommendations shown by every run planner
  remain within the same per-step ceiling. A capability-gated boxed case additionally proves that
  this allowed worker oversubscription remains inside the live outer ``cpu.max`` and long-window
  ``cpu.stat`` bandwidth envelope.
* The auto-logging profile STORE (Feature D) has an identical on-disk schema across builds: an
  unboxed run under each build (into separate ``--perf-dir`` dirs) writes the SAME set of CSV
  filenames — so ``machine_id`` + ``container_class`` (and hence ``nproc``) agree — with
  byte-identical HEADER rows and the SAME line-ending style. Data rows (timestamps, elapsed, git
  SHA) legitimately differ and are not compared. The dynamic cgroup ``cpu.*`` columns only appear
  under boxing (out of scope for the unboxed differential); their alphabetical ordering is pinned
  by each build's own perflog tests. Each reader also builds byte-identical typed summaries from
  the other implementation's freshly emitted store, and simultaneous mixed-language writers must
  preserve every expected whole-run and per-step row.
* The opt-in time-series TRACE has one cross-language schema and encoding: on hosts that can box a
  step, a one-width sweep under each build writes the same fixed columns plus the same sorted sweep
  provenance tail. Volatile timestamps, run ids, counters and timings are shape-normalized, while
  field precision, blank-vs-present semantics, sample ordering and stable provenance are compared.
  Hosts without the required cgroup-v2 scope take the same loud capability-skip path.
* The ``sweep`` ``--jobs`` error text (malformed range / not-an-integer) matches across builds, and
  a step with an empty effective ``jobs_flag`` is refused because its guest width cannot vary.
* The profile-store FEEDBACK loop + ``--planner`` agree (``compare_plan_feedback``): against a FIXED
  synthetic store, ``plan`` output is byte-identical across builds for BOTH planners and BOTH formats
  (so the contention-discounted median durations, high-percentile rss estimates, and dispatch order
  all match); the ``critical-path`` order differs from ``greedy-lpt`` (the planner really reorders);
  the hint-only ``--no-profile-feedback`` plan is also identical; and the ``--max-mem`` sizing fed by
  the store's rss estimates matches across builds and throttles below the CPU count.
* The deterministic ``scaling_model_*.json`` sidecar rebuilt from one fixed raw profile store is
  byte-identical across builds, including workload digests and the trailing newline.
* The standalone interactive sweep report embeds the same schema-1 historical dataset in both
  builds when generated from the same raw rows. Presentation markup may evolve independently;
  the graph, samples, filters, fitted-input data, traces, and profiler-capture manifests may not
  diverge.
* The remaining ``run`` comparisons pass ``--no-profile`` (no store WRITE into the harness CWD) and
  ``--no-profile-feedback`` (no store READ / hint refinement), so the base scheduling behavior under
  test stays hermetic and hint-only; feedback parity is asserted separately (above).

It also keeps the bootstrap ``--version`` / ``--help`` / no-args exit-code checks, and asserts
``--userguide`` stdout is BYTE-IDENTICAL across builds (both embed the same single-source guide).

Exit status is nonzero on any divergence. The module is kept mypy-strict clean.

    """Both builds must FINISH and REAP a step whose child escapes its process group.

    THE CASE THIS COVERS, AND WHY ITS ABSENCE MATTERED. Every other `run` comparison here uses a
    step that dies when its process group is signalled, so all of them exercise the easy teardown
    path. A step can instead leave a `setsid` child behind: the child changes session and process
    group, the intermediate parent exits, and the survivor keeps the step's stdout/stderr write ends
    open. A build that waits unconditionally for those pipes to reach EOF never returns -- it does
    not fail, it hangs, and a run that hangs writes no results at all. Two builds can therefore
    disagree completely on this path while every other check agrees, which is exactly what happened:
    the suite reported full agreement across every fixture while the two runners behaved differently
    on the one behaviour that decides whether the system can report on its own failures.

    WHAT IS ASSERTED. Both builds must return the SAME exit status, neither may hit the harness
    timeout, AND the exact recorded escapee pid must be gone before fixture cleanup runs. The last
    assertion is load-bearing: merely closing the runner's pipe and returning would still pass an
    exit-code comparison while leaking work onto the host.

    The escapee bounds itself with a short sleep and is also killed by recorded pid afterwards, so
    the fixture cannot leak a process onto a shared machine even if a build leaves it running.

    This is the check the archived work could not have: the property is a MEMORY property, so
    nothing about a normal run reveals it. Its one observable consequence is the failure dump --
    which tail survived, and the notice that says how much did not -- so that is what is compared,
    byte for byte, on a step whose output is far past the ceiling.

    Without this pairing, bounding one engine's capture and not the other's creates a divergence
    that no existing check can see: both runs still pass, both still print a dump, and only the
    engine that OOMs under a real runaway tells you which one was fixed.

    THE STEP FLOODS BOTH PIPES, and that is not incidental. A stdout-only fixture cannot see the
    divergence that a per-stream ring produces -- one ring per pipe holds TWICE the ceiling and
    announces the drop once per pipe, each notice counting only its own half -- so it would have
    passed while the two engines disagreed about both numbers in the notice and about how much of
    the step the runner was holding. The step writes its whole stdout burst, pauses so the order
    is settled rather than raced, then its whole stderr burst: the surviving tail is then pure

    the ones the documented reconstruction rests on:

    * ``run``: every step of one execution shares one id (``[0, 0]``), even though the rows are
      flushed by the same sink, so an id minted per BATCH would split a single run into groups
      that never overlap by construction.
    * ``sweep``: every iteration is its OWN execution with its own Runner and its own monotonic
      origin, so it must get its own id (``[0, 1, 2]``). One shared id across a strictly
      sequential sweep makes the documented rule — same ``run_id`` rows overlap iff their

#: A fixed synthetic store for :func:`compare_memory_feedback`, carrying the applied-cap and

#: 8 GiB applied cap and never OOMed:
#:
#: * ``g.learned`` sat at 2 GiB with every counter at zero, so its peaks are real observations.
#: * ``g.pinned`` peaked EXACTLY at the ceiling every time: identical ``memory_max_bytes``,
#:   opposite meaning. A build that ignored the provenance would derive a number for it too.
#: * ``g.throttled`` peaked at the same comfortable 2 GiB as ``g.learned`` but recorded
#:   ``memory_events_high > 0`` — a SOFT ceiling was throttling it into direct reclaim, so its
#:   peak is suppressed. Byte-for-byte its ``peak_bytes`` and ``memory_max_bytes`` match
#:   ``g.learned``; only the counter differs, so a build that reads ``max``/``oom_kill`` but not
#:   ``high`` gives it the same learned cap and this fixture catches that.
#: * ``g.failed`` peaked at the same comfortable 2 GiB with every counter at zero, but every one
#:   of its six runs was KILLED: ``ok=false``, ``returncode=137`` (SIGKILL, which is what an
#:   ancestor-scope OOM kill looks like from inside the reader). Its peaks are where the step got
#:   to before it died.
#: * ``g.four`` recorded only FOUR comfortable samples. Nothing here passes a sample threshold to
#:   either build, so this step is the only thing that observes the SHIPPED
#:   ``DEFAULT_MIN_UNCENSORED_SAMPLES``, and the two builds disagreeing about it shows up as a
#:   difference in its line.

    The other half of the decline contract, and the half that is easy to over-correct into. ONE
    step whose ten recorded runs were every one of them pinned to the ceiling they were given:
    nine at 8589934592 B and one at 34359738368 B. The DAG authors 1073741824 B — BELOW what the
    store proves the step has already used, which is the direction
    :func:`_memory_feedback_declines_reach_admission` does not cover.

    Without the flag the censoring-blind feedback fits the 9/10 nearest-rank percentile of those
    peaks — the ninth smallest, 8589934592 B — and admission models 10737418240 B. With the flag
    the step is DECLINED, because no peak says what it wanted; but one of them says it reached
    34359738368 B, so that is the floor the decline keeps and admission models 42949672960 B.

    So turning the flag on RAISES the modelled footprint here, which is the only direction a
    censored sample may move it. Both numbers are named literally: a build that restored the
    authored figure alone would report a far smaller second number, and a build that added the
    20% margin to the floor — a floor is a fact about the past, not an estimate of the next run —
    would report a different one again.

    ``derive_build_jobs`` used to overwrite ``CARGO_BUILD_JOBS`` unconditionally, so an operator
    who set it — having sized a memory cap against exactly that pool — lost it with no word said.
    Reading the variable back as intent is not the fix either: the runner SETS it — both engines
    pass ``--setenv=CARGO_BUILD_JOBS`` into the scope, which is the path this check drives — so the
    in-scope process would read its own derivation as an instruction and stop refining per step.

    This is the one mechanism that can see both engines resolve it, on the boxing path where the
    substitution actually happens. It checks two observables per leg, because the sentence alone
    is cheap to keep true while the wiring rots:

    * the SENTENCE each build prints, which must be identical and name the right authority; and
    * the width the STEP actually received, echoed by the step's own command. Unstated, that must
      be strictly below the scope-wide number (downward refinement still happening); stated, it
      must be exactly the operator's number, unrefined.

    Deleting the ``DAGRUN_OPERATOR_BUILD_JOBS`` forwarding in one engine leaves the sentence
    correct and breaks the second observable, which is the whole reason it is here.
