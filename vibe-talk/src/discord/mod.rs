//! Discord implementation of the provider-neutral chat interface.
//!
//! v0 needs exactly two operations: read the recent messages of a channel, and post one message
//! back. Both are pulled on demand — this server has no gateway connection and no webhook
//! receiver, so it never needs to be running for a message to survive.

pub mod fake;
pub mod http;
pub mod ratelimit;

// Compatibility re-exports for callers that used the original Discord-specific public names.
// New server code depends on `crate::chat` directly.

/// The bot's own Discord user id, read out of its token.
///
/// A bot token is three dot-separated parts, and the FIRST is the bot's user id in base64url. So
/// the account this server posts as is knowable without a single API call, without a new trait
/// method for every client and fake to implement, and without a startup step that can fail.
///
/// # Why this matters at all
///
/// The channel view colours a message by who sent it, and the one account it must recognise is
/// this bridge's own -- those messages are the OWNER's words, posted on his behalf. The page used
/// to learn that id only as a side effect of the reader replying from the app or of the live feed
/// delivering a `self_posted` message. A reader who had done neither saw every message fall
/// through to the same "somebody else" colour, including their own, which is exactly the bug this
/// closes: with the bridge unidentified, it also counts as a second bot, and the "the only bot
/// that is not us" guess for the coding agent becomes a coin toss it declines to call.
///
/// Returns `None` rather than guessing when the token is not in that shape. Degrading to the old
/// learned-later behaviour is correct; inventing an id would mislabel somebody else's messages as
/// the owner's.
