//! Durable server state, behind one trait.
//!
//! Everything else in this crate is stateless: a request arrives, Discord is asked, an answer is
//! computed, nothing is kept. This module is the exception, and it is deliberately the *only*
//! exception. Two things need to outlive a process:
//!
//! * the **conversation transcript** the `/voice` page builds while the owner is talking, which
//!   today evaporates on a reload; and
//! * the **inbox state** — how far the owner has read in each channel, and which individual
//!   messages he has dealt with.
//!
//! # Read state is OURS, and it is never synchronised with Discord
//!
//! This is the decision that has to be stated once, plainly, rather than discovered later from a
//! divergence. **Discord does not share read state with bots.** There is no ack route a bot may
//! call, no read-state field on the channel object a bot can see, and no `read_state` in the
//! gateway `READY` payload for a bot user. So the read marks held here are this server's own
//! record of what the owner has been shown *by this server*:
//!
//! * **No sync-in.** Nothing here is ever populated from Discord. Marking a channel read in the
//!   Discord app has no effect on vibe-talk.
//! * **No sync-back.** Marking a channel read here posts nothing, acks nothing, and changes
//!   nothing in Discord. The unread badge in the Discord app will not move.
//!
//! That holds for the per-message overlay `#50 todo-view` adds on top of it just as it holds for
//! the channel read marks: dismissing a message here is this server's record and nobody else's.
//!
//! **The store is single-tenant.** Every read mark and every dismissal is "the owner's", with no
//! column saying WHOSE — one file, one person. Sharing a deployment between two operators would
//! silently merge their inboxes, and that is not a configuration this decision survives; it would
//! have to be revisited, not worked around.
//!
//! Anything that shows a read mark to a human has to say that, because "read" is a word that
//! already means something to a Discord user and this is not that thing.
//!
//! # Why a trait, and why SQLite behind it
//!
//! The trait is as much the point as the backend. A handler that reached for `rusqlite` directly
//! would pin the deployment to one host with one filesystem forever; every call site goes through
//! [`StateStore`] so a hosted backend can be substituted without touching one of them. This is
//! the same shape [`crate::chat::ChatClient`], [`crate::elevenlabs::SignedUrlProvider`] and
//! [`crate::retrieval::Ranker`] already have: a live implementation, plus a fake that can
//! genuinely fail.
//!
//! The shipped implementation is [`sqlite::SqliteStore`] — one file, hand-written SQL, a
//! `user_version` migration ladder. The schema is small enough that an ORM would be a dependency
//! bought with nothing, and SQLite gives the one property a file format does not: a torn write
//! rolls back rather than leaving half a record.
//!
//! # What is stored, and how it is erased
//!
//! Transcripts are the owner's own speech *and* Discord text this server read aloud, which is
//! written by third parties. It is the first thing this project retains at rest, so:
//!
//! * the database file is `0600` and its directory `0700`;
//! * retention is bounded by [`Retention`] — a conversation count, a per-conversation turn count,
//!   a cached-summary count, a dismissal count, and an age in days that applies to the first
//!   three — enforced on every write, not by a sweeper that might not run; and pins are bounded
//!   by [`MAX_PINS_PER_CHANNEL`] on every pin, for the reasons given there;
//! * [`StateStore::purge_everything`] erases all of it, and an operator who does not trust that
//!   can delete the single file the store lives in.
