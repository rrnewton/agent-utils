//! The access log: one line per request, so that **silence is legible**.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! A voice agent reported reading a Discord channel and posting a reply. It had done neither. It
//! described a digest it had invented, and it named tools this server does not have
//! (`file_system_read`, `code_execution_sandbox`, `web_scraper`). The only way to disprove it was
//! to go and look at the channel, because at `RUST_LOG=info` this server logged **nothing per
//! request** — so "the agent never called us" and "the agent called us and we answered" produced
//! byte-identical output: none.
//!
//! That is the failure this module removes. An absence of evidence was doing the work of evidence
//! of absence, and it could not. Every request now leaves exactly one INFO line, so an empty log
//! is a *finding* — nobody called — rather than an ambiguity. The startup banner says so out
//! loud, because a reader has to know the log would have spoken.
//!
//! # What is deliberately NOT in a line
//!
//! * **No credential, ever.** Not the token, not a prefix of it, not a hash of it. A hash prefix
//!   still lets an attacker who has the log confirm a guess, and there is no operational question
//!   here that a token value answers. What matters is *which class* of credential arrived —
//!   read or write — and [`Credential`] carries exactly that much.
//! * **No channel text at INFO.** Message content is third-party data written by other people; it
//!   does not belong in an operator's log or in whatever ships that log onward. Ids, counts, and
//!   lengths answer the operational questions ("did the post go through, and how long was it?")
//!   without copying the content anywhere.
