//! "The voice service is not responding", as one content-free log line.
//!
//! `voice-unresponsive-signal`. A live call once stayed green for its whole length while every
//! turn produced no speech and no transcript: the socket was open, turns completed, and each one
//! carried PCM that nobody could hear. Nothing on the page and nothing in this log said so. The
//! page now judges each turn from the frames `vibe-talk-v1` already carries and reports what it
//! concluded here, so a log reader can see the episode without anyone having been on the call.
//!
//! **Content-free by construction.** [`HealthReport`] is a closed set of fields: two closed enums,
//! a flag, and integers. An unknown field, an unknown [`Cause`], or an unknown protocol is refused
//! rather than echoed, so the one line it writes has no free-text field at all — not the words
//! said, not an error message, not an id, not a provider.
//!
//! **Bounded.** The page reports each cause at most once per call, and a recovery only after an
//! unresponsive report it attempted, so a well-behaved call writes at most seven lines: four
//! causes and three recoveries. The server does not trust that: [`LogBudget`] caps the lines this
//! route writes per minute across every caller, and [`MAX_BODY_BYTES`] caps what it will read.
//! The first refusal in a window writes one line saying records are being dropped, so throttling
//! is visible without becoming a flood of its own.
