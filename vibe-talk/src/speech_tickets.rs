//! Everything a read-aloud needs, resolved BEFORE the reader taps.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Reading a message aloud used to do all of its work on the tap: fetch a window of fifty messages
//! from Discord to find one by id, normalise its text for speech, ask ElevenLabs which voice the
//! agent speaks in, and only then start generating audio. Four waits in series, every time, and the
//! reader is sitting there through all of them having already been shown the very text they are
//! waiting to hear.
//!
//! The page already HAS that text — it drew it. So none of that work needs to happen on the tap. It
//! happens once, when read-aloud mode is turned on, and what the tap gets is a TICKET: an opaque
//! string naming one message whose text is already resolved and waiting. Playing it is then a
//! single hop that does a map lookup and starts forwarding bytes.
//!
//! # Why a ticket rather than the text
//!
//! The obvious shortcut is to let the page send the text it already has. That is refused here for
//! the same reason `/speak` always refused it: this server holds the operator's ElevenLabs
//! credential, and a route that reads back whatever it is handed is a route that spends their
//! balance on anything at all. The text in a ticket was resolved by this server FROM A REAL MESSAGE
//! and cannot be edited afterwards, so the guarantee is if anything stronger than before — it is
//! fixed at mint time rather than re-derived under a caller-supplied id.
//!
//! # Why the ticket is a capability
//!
//! It travels as a URL, because that is the whole point: an `<audio src>` cannot carry an
//! `Authorization` header, and without it the browser cannot stream. So the ticket has to
//! authenticate on its own. It is 256 bits from the system CSPRNG, it names exactly one message, it
//! expires in minutes, and the store it lives in is capped. What it grants — hearing one message
//! the holder could already read, plus appending bounded content-free playback timings for that
//! same read — is deliberately the smallest thing that makes the URL work. The timing callback
//! takes no bearer header for exactly the same reason as the audio element: the random ticket is
//! intentionally its capability too. It answers one 404 for a ticket that was never minted, one
//! that has expired, and one whose audio has not been played yet, so it reveals nothing the audio
//! route does not.
//!
//! It WILL appear in the page's DOM and in this server's access log, which is the cost of the
//! approach and the reason for the short life and the narrow scope.
