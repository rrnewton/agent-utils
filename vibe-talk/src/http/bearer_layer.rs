//! The door every bearer-token `/api/` request passes before it is routed.
//!
//! `#42 api-scope-first`. The handler extractors ([`super::api::ReadScope`],
//! [`super::api::WriteScope`]) keep the parsers from answering a caller without a credential, but
//! routing answers before any handler runs: an unknown path would get 404 and an unserved method
//! 405 with an `allow` header, so an anonymous caller could map the API while a real route said
//! 401. This layer answers that caller 401 first, with the same status, headers and body a route
//! gives, so "every `/api/` route requires a bearer token" is true of every answer under `/api/`.
//!
//! It must wrap the router from OUTSIDE (see [`super::router`]): `Router::layer` runs after
//! routing has picked an endpoint, so the 405 path would still add its `allow` header to this 401.
//!
//! It checks only that ONE of the two browser tokens was presented. Which scope a route needs stays
//! with the route, so a read token still gets the route's 403, and a caller with a valid token
//! still gets 404 and 405 from routing exactly as before.
