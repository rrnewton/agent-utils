//! Bounded walks over `conversations.history` and `conversations.replies`.
//!
//! The rest of the server asks for Discord's two page shapes: the NEWEST `n` messages older than a
//! cursor, and the OLDEST `n` messages newer than one. Slack serves each feed in one fixed order —
//! history newest first, replies oldest first — and a server may cap any page well below the
//! `limit` asked for. Two of the four combinations therefore follow the feed's own order and stop
//! as soon as they have enough; the other two need the whole window between the cursor and the end.
//!
//! # Every walk is bounded, and the bound never skips a message
//!
//! A walk spends at most [`MAX_WALK_PAGES`] (or [`MAX_WINDOW_PAGES`]) requests before it changes
//! strategy, and what it returns is always gap-free against the cursor it was given: walking again
//! from the newest (or oldest) returned message continues exactly where this page stopped. This
//! matters most for [`crate::live::poll_once`], which walks forward with `after=` and would lose any
//! message a page skipped, for good.
//!
//! * In feed order (history backward, replies forward) the first pages already touch the cursor,
//!   so running out of pages simply returns a SHORTER page. The caller's next step resumes from it.
//! * Against feed order (history forward, replies backward) running out of pages leaves the
//!   messages nearest the cursor unread. Rather than return the far ones, the walk searches by
//!   time — galloping outward from the cursor with single-page probes — until a window adjacent
//!   to the cursor answers in one page, and returns that.
//! * Proving that a stretch holds no real messages means reading it, so a run of system events
//!   longer than [`MAX_NARROWING_PROBES`] probes can read is not crossed in one call. That call
//!   returns NO messages (never later ones) and remembers how far it proved the stretch empty; the
//!   next call with the same cursor — the live poller's next tick — resumes from there. A search
//!   that could not prove anything at all fails the read instead.
