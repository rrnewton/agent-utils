//! Messages that are read automatically: the owner's noise rules. `#196 auto-read-noise`.
//!
//! A coding agent posts `_Working…_` as a thread reply the moment it starts on something, and the
//! real answer arrives later as a separate message. In the owner's main space nine of the latest
//! fifty messages were exactly that placeholder, and every one of them sat in the to-do list, got
//! an unread row, and was counted in every digest as though it were news. This module is how a
//! message like that is treated as already read without anybody tapping Done on it.
//!
//! # Read state is still OURS
//!
//! "Read" here is this server's own local read state — the same overlay `#50 todo-view` and
//! `#61 unread-status` describe in [`crate::store`]. Nothing here moves the source chat service's
//! own read cursor, and nothing here is written to it. The upstream-read route is a different act
//! and this module never reaches it.
//!
//! # Evaluated, never recorded
//!
//! The obvious implementation — dismiss every matching message as it arrives — is the wrong one,
//! for three reasons that each turn into a bug the owner cannot diagnose:
//!
//! * **An edit would not bring the message back.** Some agents edit the placeholder into the real
//!   answer. A dismissal written when the text said "Working…" would keep the finished answer out
//!   of the list forever.
//! * **Removing a rule would not undo it.** Every message the rule ever caught would stay
//!   dismissed, so a mistaken rule could only be cleaned up message by message.
//! * **It would be a write on a read.** Matching happens while serving a read, and a read-scope
//!   caller never writes anything durable here; see [`crate::http`].
//!
//! So a rule is applied to the message's CURRENT text every time a message is served, and the
//! answer rides on the message as [`crate::model::Message::noise`]. The page, the to-do list, the
//! counts, the digest and the agent's tools all read that one flag, so there is one predicate and
//! it lives here — the page deliberately has no JavaScript copy of the matcher.
//!
//! # Deliberately trivial
//!
//! Not a regular expression. A rule matches a message when the message's WHOLE text, normalised,
//! equals the rule, normalised the same way — see [`normalise`]. A rule ending in `*` matches the
//! START of a message instead. That is the whole language, and it is small on purpose: a rule
//! hides messages from the person it is for, so it has to be possible to predict exactly what one
//! will catch by reading it. A regex whose author got it slightly wrong hides real messages
//! silently, which is the one failure this feature must not have.
//!
//! # A failure shows more, never less
//!
//! When the rules or the exemptions cannot be read, nothing is treated as noise: the reader sees
//! the placeholders exactly as he did before this existed. The opposite fallback would hide
//! messages on the strength of a store that is not answering.
