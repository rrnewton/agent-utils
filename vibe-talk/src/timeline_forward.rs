//! Forward timeline reads: what changed in a view since an earlier read. `#203 incremental-refresh`.
//!
//! The owner's question was whether a refresh at 7:15, after a read at 7:00, could ask for just
//! the quarter of an hour in between. Backward pages could not: every refresh re-read the newest
//! page of the whole view. A newest read now hands back `next_after`, and a read with
//! `after=<next_after>` answers only the entries new or changed in that view since then, oldest
//! first, with a [`crate::threads::TimelineDelta`] saying whether edits and deletions are included.
//!
//! # Two kinds of cursor behind one envelope
//!
//! * **Native** — the backend answers `after` itself, and issued its own cursor in
//!   [`TimelinePage::next_after`]. vibe-talk hands that cursor back untouched. A bridge that keeps
//!   a change record answers with `complete: true`, so one call carries every edit and deletion.
//! * **Generic** — any other backend. The cursor is a provider timestamp, an overlap below it, and
//!   the entries already seen inside that overlap. [`generic_since`] reads newest pages and keeps
//!   what is newer: correct for every backend, with `complete: false`, and no cheaper than a newest
//!   read. Entries with equal timestamps are told apart by the seen set, an entry the provider
//!   lists up to [`GENERIC_OVERLAP_SECONDS`] late is still returned, and the local clock is never
//!   compared with a provider time.
//!
//! The page only ever sees the envelope, and a backend never does: [`decode`] binds each cursor to
//! the channel, view and thread it was issued for, and refuses any other before anything is read.
//! It is unsigned, like the backends' own backward cursors, and for the same reason: forging one
//! only reads the same allowlisted channel the caller can already read.
//!
//! Every row a delta carries is an upsert by id. Delivering an entry twice is harmless; skipping
//! one is the defect this must not have, so every overlap here errs toward the former.
