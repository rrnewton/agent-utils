"""Switch a channel between All and Main in real Chromium, with every timeline request counted.

`#220 view-switch-instant`. The owner, 2026-10-08: "ALL view has loaded all the messages so switching
to MAIN channel only should basically just hide thread replies. But instead I saw it flash to a blank
screen and do the message fetching/loading animation. Let's fix that. I don't want to fetch already
cached data and I don't want to WAIT in the UI if I don't have to." The fake-DOM suite
(tests/js/voice_page.test.mjs) covers each branch of a switch; this covers what only a browser engine
can show: what is painted, frame by frame, while the page switches and while a read is on the wire.

It serves the checked-out page and the small fake API of tests/offline_cache_browser.py from one
loopback origin, at a phone's size, over a channel longer than the screen whose thread replies sit
between its own messages, and intercepts every timeline request the browser sends. Then:

  sign in and open the channel, in All, read once -> from the middle of the channel, Main, All, Main
  and All again, picked in the bar's real thread picker: no request at all, the list never empty and
  the loading line never shown -- watched on every change to either and on every frame -- and the
  message at the top of the screen where it was -> reload with the saved rows removed, so the page
  reopens in Main, the view last chosen, and reads only Main -> pick All, which has never been read:
  All is up at once from the rows the page holds, its one read held on the server meanwhile with the
  freshness pill saying it is refreshing, and merged when it lands, the reader's message still where
  it was, nothing read twice, and again no empty list and no loading line -> eight rows a read from
  here, paged by `before`, as every real channel is: reopened in All, Main is drawn from All's newest
  page with no read and keeps its way back, its first step back being Main's own newest page read
  behind the rows -> reopened in Main and walked back to its start, All, never read, is drawn from
  Main's rows at once and walked back to the message near the top of the screen before its read is
  drawn: All's newest page alone is never painted, the message stays where it was, and again no empty
  list and no loading line.

Pass --web-root DIR to run it against another copy of the page -- the page before `#220` fails at the
first switch -- and --screenshots DIR to keep a PNG of each stage.
