"""Exercise /voice's saved-message snapshot in real Chromium at a phone's size.

The fake-DOM suite (tests/js/voice_page.test.mjs) covers every branch of the snapshot. This covers
what only a browser engine can: real localStorage, a real reload, real fetch failures, the Cache
Storage and service-worker registries, and layout at 412x915 and at a 1280x800 desk. For each of
those it serves the checked-out assets and a small fake API from one loopback origin, then walks
one reader through:

  sign in, open the channel — in All, the default where the provider has threads — and read Threads
  and Main too -> reload with the network held: the page reopens on the channel in All by itself,
  its saved rows drawn before any answer (`#189 restore-ui-state`) -> one bounded newest-page read
  of All, sent once the token is proved and the live stream has attached, merges a new row without
  duplicating -> switching views makes no request -> a reload with the API unreachable reopens on
  Main, the view chosen in that channel and kept as its own (`#205 channel-view-memory`), at the
  message a reader parked mid-list was on, keeps the rows and says so -> a reload whose refresh
  fails keeps them and says that -> signing out removes them from the screen and the device. Before
  the reloads, a refresh also fails and recovers in place, on the channel's own poll, under a reader
  at the top, in the middle and at the newest line.

While the freshness pill is up — refreshing, offline, failed — it must cover neither the view tabs
nor the list's header seam or first row, and #scroll-area must be the same box with it as without
it (`#32 freshness-pill-overlap`). As the pill's room and the error panel above the list come and
go, a scrolled reader's line stays where it is on the screen, and a reader at the newest line stays
there (`#33 error-banner-scroll-shift`).

On a touchscreen, a real finger parked at the newest line and drawn up past the end of the list
reads the channel once, says "Updated" at the foot of the list and does not reload the page; a drag
short of the threshold reads nothing (`#188 pull-refresh-bottom`).

At the newest line there is no jump to the newest message; halfway up the channel it is at the lower
left of the chip row in the dark theme — legible, a 44px target, inside the list's column and above
the dock, clear of the floating pills and of every other chip forced up beside it, at the ordinary
type size and at 150%, where on a phone the row wraps and the others go up a line. A real tap a few
pixels above the drawn chip lands on the newest message, reads nothing, starts no pull, and the jump
is gone. It is decided again when the list changes size under a reader who has not scrolled, with the
list's scroll events held back from the page: it comes when the newest message grows below a reader on
the newest line, and goes when it shrinks under one just above it (`#207 scrollback-jump`).

Opening a thread whose title is longer than the screen, with a long unbroken token and inline code
in its reply, leaves the page no wider than the viewport and no shown part of the main screen past
its right edge; on a phone the title is ellipsised instead (`#36 thread-view-phone-overflow`). With
every floating chip showing at once and that thread scrolled to its end, no chip covers the reply
composer's text box or its Send button (`#194 thread-picker-polish`).

The search glass floats on the pill's line rather than costing a header row (`#197
floating-search`): on the main screen no header strip stands above the list, on the call view and
the channel alike; wherever the pill is measured the glass is centred on its line, over the list and
clear of it and of the head of the list, drawn larger than the pill and at least 36px across since
the owner called the pill-sized glass very small (`#211 link-filter`), and a square around the disc
presses it. A real tap below the
disc opens the search as a bar across the top of the list — no wider than the list, not hanging
over what is above it, the pill given way and the head of the list clear of it — the bar filters,
and the glass folds it back with #scroll-area unmoved. Settings still has its title bar and a way
back, and in a thread neither floating thing covers the heading's Back button or title.

Last, a fresh page signed in with a read-scope token reads the channel without a single 4xx answer
or console error: the stored-conversation routes are write-scope, answered 403 here as the server
answers them, and the page must not ask (`#38 read-token-conversation-probe`).

Then, in the dark theme, a second reader pins (`#206 pin-message`): a pin made elsewhere shows on its
row as a "Pinned" chip whose words read against it, and a gold edge; the ⋯ menus of that row and of
an unpinned one open as Copy text, Pin, and the two that mark read under a hairline and a caption —
for a provider that can move its own read marker, whose menu is the widest — every item at least
44px tall, on the screen, and answering a tap at its centre; Pin shows at once and reaches the
server; and the open search bar carries the Pinned filter immediately left of the glass, with Links
immediately left of it — each a 44px target every point of which presses it, clear of the other, of
the glass's own square and of a field still 140px wide beside the count — whose tap shows the pins,
clear of the bar, and which the glass takes away with the bar.

Then, in the dark theme, a reader looks for links (`#211 link-filter`): with the bar open, Links and
Pinned measure as above, and a real tap on Links leaves only the rows that hold a link, each showing
its links where its text was, under its author and time — one per line, each a real link opening a
new tab, at least 44px tall, a Markdown or chat-service link by its name, and an address longer than
the row cut short on screen with its href whole. A real tap on a link opens a new tab at that address
without navigating the app, folding the row or opening its details; the glass takes Links away with
the bar; and over the call view, which has no pins, Links stands beside the glass on its own.

And where a phone reader's own settings wrap a row's meta line — the page zoomed to a 313px
viewport, or the root font at 115%, 130% and 150% — every row's ⋯ menu, and the pinned row's in the
Pinned filter, opens wholly on the screen with every item a thumb can reach, in both provider shapes,
and that row's Unpin is tapped for real. A menu hung from the "⋯" opened off the left of the screen
wherever the "⋯" wrapped to the start of a line. Under the same settings, at 360px and 412px, the open
search bar with Links on and its count up keeps the glass full size and each filter a 44px target, and
its field still leaves room for a query's text, which buttons that grew with the font took away; the
Links view under it shows each link on its own 44px line, clear of the bar; and the kinds of link
under Links measure as below.

Then the kinds of link under Links (`#212 link-filter`), in the dark theme at 412px, 360px, 360px at
150% type and a 1280px desk, over a channel holding GitHub pull requests, commits and runs of Actions
beside documents: a real tap on Links brings up PRs, Commits and Actions, all on, with how many links
of each are in view, in a row below the bar and under the Links icon — centred on it, or right-aligned
under the bar's end where centred would run past it — wholly inside the viewport, each a target at
least 44px each way every point of which presses it, covering neither the field, the glass, the
filters, the pill nor the first row, its words legible on and off and the two states drawn apart. A
real tap on PRs takes the pull requests out of the rows that hold them, and a row left with nothing
goes; Commits and Actions off as well leave only the documents and the GitHub issue, which is no kind.
After a reload the three are still off; turned on again every link is back; the glass takes the row
away; and over the call view, where Links stands beside the glass, the row is right-aligned under the
bar's end and still inside the screen. With over a hundred links of each kind loaded, every button
reading "99+", the row measures the same at 313px, and at 360px under 130% and 150% type.

And where the filters empty the list (`EMPTY_SIZES`): a phone reader at the channel's newest line
turns all three kinds off, types text that only a row without a link matches, types text nothing
matches, or turns Links on over a channel with no link — at 412px under 150% type and on the two
phones with the keyboard up, where the composer below the emptied list still overflows it. The
sentence saying why is then wholly on the screen, below the bar and the kinds of link, with nothing
covering a word of it and no jump to the newest message offered; undone, the rows come back with the
reader at the newest line.

Then, in a second fresh profile at each size, a channel whose foot holds five replies to messages
above them (`#204 reply-arrow`): from the owner, the agent and a third party, and between them in
every state a row recedes in — the owner's own, read by default; one somebody answered; one swiped
Done; an automatic placeholder; and one in none of them. Every reply's arrow is a 44px square in
the gutter to the left of its own box: touching the box, inside the list, within the row's height,
covering none of the row's text or buttons, and the thing a tap on it lands on. On a screenshot of
that square, the mark is drawn in the accent at 3:1 or better against the page beside it, however
far its row recedes — measured in pixels, because a computed colour knows nothing of the opacity and
filter of the row around it. All of that at the default type size, at 150% type and in the dark
scheme, with the page no wider than the viewport. A real tap on the newest reply's arrow, from the
newest line, brings the message it answers under the floating pill and lights it without folding
the reply; "Back to reply", tapped, brings the reply back and goes; and in reading mode the arrow
still only jumps, with no read of the reply asked for.

Then, in a third fresh profile at each size and in the dark theme, the coding agent's tiles (`#213
row-side-borders`), beside the owner's and a third party's rows and in every state that draws a
row's border differently — summarised, its summary failed, being read, asked to be read, the kept
place, pinned, swiped Done, an automatic placeholder, a reply, the owner's own read by default, one
somebody answered, and on a desk under the pointer. Every row has four drawn sides, and the agent's
tiles are square, with a left and a right side the width, style and colour of their top, but for a
summary's bar, which is the left side and wider than the right. On a phone a tile reaches from one
edge of the screen to the other, a reply's from its gutter to the right edge; on a desk it is inside
the reading column. Nothing on the page scrolls sideways, at 360px as at the other sizes.

Then, in a fourth fresh profile at each size and in the dark scheme, a channel whose replies sit both
directly under what they answer and far from it, around a thread whose replies are scattered among
other messages (`#214 reply-arrow`, `#215 reply-coalesce`). A reply directly under the message it
answers draws the arrow whose head meets that row — on its foot within 1px, on the flat past its
rounded corner, or, where that row starts at or beyond the reply's box, on its left side within 1px —
found from the pixels, where the head's width runs out — and a press at that point or on the middle of
the head is that arrow's, even where the head is drawn over the row above's own arrow; a reply to a
message elsewhere draws the arrow that leaves the middle of its box's left side, within 1px, and runs
at 45 degrees. Both at the default type size and at 150%. A real tap or click on each such head jumps
to the row above and lights it, and two on the head drawn over another arrow gather the replies of the
row it meets, not of the message that row answers. A real tap on the root's N replies gathers its
replies under it, in time order, with the root where it was on the screen within 1px; one bridge in the
accent comes out of the flat of the root's foot, each reply's part of it starting at the foot of the
row above and its line reaching the reply's left edge, all drawn, and still so with a reply in the
stack opened by a tap on its text and at 150% type; the X is a 44px target on the screen, left of the
spine, that puts the replies back in time order with the root unmoved; and two real taps on the arrow
of a reply far below the root gather them again, with that reply where it was on the screen and no jump
taken first.

First of all, the dock (`#218 desktop-dock`), in the dark theme, at a 1280x800 desk, a 1600x1000 one
and the two phones, on the call view — idle, live, and after a call with its note under Talk — and on
the channel, under a thirty-character name, with a thread open beside it, and under a short name. On a
desk every control in it is 32 to 40px tall and at least 32px wide, inside the list's column, and
overlapping no other; the dock is one row (at most 56px) where everything fits — the idle call, the
short name, and the long name once the column is dragged wide — and at most 100px where it does not,
the reading buttons then under the switch at the right of the second row; the pane reads Sound, Clear,
Hang up, Talk and Hide read, Pace, Read, left to right; the channel's picker is as wide as its name,
with a thread open too, and only in the narrowest column is it cut, ending in an ellipsis, with the
view picker at its floor and nothing scrolled out of the pack; and a Tab walk from the gear visits the
controls in the order they are seen, each with a ring nothing clips. On a phone the dock is the one it
was before: 149px, its bar and its tile of large buttons at their old heights and widths.

Pass --screenshots DIR to keep a PNG of each step for review.

    A phone in the dark theme at one of `EMPTY_SIZES`, the channel opened at its newest line, and the
    list emptied by real taps and typing as `mode` says. The sentence must then be wholly on the screen
    below the bar and the kinds of link (`EMPTY_SENTENCE_JS`): the composer below every list kept the
    list overflowing with all its rows gone, so a reader left at the newest line had the sentence under
    the kinds' three buttons — at 412px and 150% type — or, with the keyboard up, above the screen.
    No jump to the newest message is offered past it. Undone the same way, the rows come back with the reader at the newest line again. Answers how far
    the list was scrolled while the sentence was up.
