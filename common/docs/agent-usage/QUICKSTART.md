# agent-usage quickstart

**Problem.** Claude Code and Codex agents cannot see their own budgets. A person types
`/status` and pages to the Usage tab ("Current session 8% used, resets 8:10am; Current week
22% used, resets Oct 11"), but an agent has no cheap way to read that, and no idea how fast it
is spending. Starting a throwaway harness to type `/status` costs a full start-up, and probing
with a model call costs tokens.

**What agent-usage does.** One command prints, for each harness:

- every plan window the provider reports (Claude: current session, current week, per-model
  weeks such as Fable; Codex: the 5-hour and weekly windows), its percentage used and its reset
  time;
- the burn over the last 15 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours and 24 hours, and whether the window
  would fill before it resets at the current rate;
- local token use from Claude Code transcripts and Codex's thread totals, which also works where
  there are no plan limits (API keys, cloud providers, gateways).

It reads the same structured sources the CLIs' own `/status` screens use: Claude's claude.ai
usage endpoint (one HTTPS GET with the stored login) and Codex's app-server
`account/rateLimits/read` request. No model call, no session, no tokens.

**Dependencies.** Linux or macOS, `curl`, `sqlite3` (optional, for Codex token totals), and a
Rust toolchain to build. Plan windows need a subscription login (claude.ai for Claude, ChatGPT
for Codex); without one the tool says so and still reports local tokens.

## Install

```bash
cargo build --release --manifest-path rs/Cargo.toml -p agent-usage
install -m 0755 rs/target/release/agent-usage ~/bin/agent-usage
```

## Use

```bash
agent-usage                 # report; polls a provider whose newest reading is over 2 minutes old
agent-usage --json          # the same, for scripts and agents
agent-usage --cached        # never poll; report from the history only
agent-usage daemon --detach # poll every 15 minutes in the background so burn rates have data
agent-usage daemon status   # is it running, how fresh is the history
agent-usage daemon stop
```

Example: a claude.ai Max login with three hours of 15-minute history, followed by a host whose
Claude Code runs on a cloud provider (no plan limits; local tokens only). The numbers are made up
for the first part and real for the second.

claude: no plan limits to read (read now): no claude.ai login; this environment uses vertex, which has no plan limits
  local tokens (transcripts on this host):
    15m:   452 requests,   125M tokens (output 196k, cache read 122M, cache write 2.7M, input 904)
     1h:   823 requests,   244M tokens (output 449k, cache read 240M, cache write 3.6M, input 1.7k)
     3h:  1431 requests,   532M tokens (output 841k, cache read 526M, cache write 5.6M, input 2.9k)
    24h: 10769 requests,   4.5G tokens (output 6.0M, cache read 4.4G, cache write 38M, input 22k)
```

Burn rates need at least two readings, so start the daemon once per host (or run
`agent-usage daemon --once` from cron). History lives in `~/.cache/agent-usage/history.jsonl`.

Run `agent-usage userguide` for the full reference: sources, the burn arithmetic, files,
environment variables, costs and failure modes.
