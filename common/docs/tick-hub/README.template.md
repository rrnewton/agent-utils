# tick-hub

`tick-hub` lets one cron job, timer, or coordinator heartbeat evaluate many
recurring responsibilities, each on its own cadence. It emits stable `HEALTH`,
`ACTION`, `NOTE`, and `ERROR` lines for people or automation to consume.

Reminders, shell gates, freshness checks, and emitted actions are caller-owned
JSON or YAML configuration. The engine is deterministic when given an explicit
clock value, and it persists cadence state only when asked to flush.

## Quick start

Save this as `ops.yaml`:

```yaml
reminders:
  - name: refresh_cache
    cadence_secs: 3600
    emit:
      kind: action
      skill: refresh-cache
      title: refresh the shared cache
health_checks:
  - name: newest_snapshot
    glob: /srv/snapshots/*.tar.zst
    threshold_secs: 86400
```

Run a dry tick or persist its updated cadence state:

```sh
tick-hub tick --config ops.yaml --no-header
tick-hub tick --config ops.yaml --flush --no-header
```

Explore the complete interface with:

```sh
tick-hub quickstart
tick-hub --help
tick-hub --userguide
```

## Output contract

- `HEALTH:` reports `ok`, `stale`, or `missing` freshness.
- `ACTION:` identifies one handler plus fields and a title.
- `NOTE:` carries informational state.
- `ERROR:` reports a gate or operational failure.

The prefix is the record type. Consumers should parse that prefix and treat the
remaining fields as line-oriented data.
