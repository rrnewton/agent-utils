# dagrun

`dagrun` executes a directed acyclic graph of build and test steps with
dependency ordering, bounded concurrency, resource-aware planning, Linux cgroup
containment, and per-step profiling.

It provides:

- strict JSON and YAML DAG loading;
- deterministic list, visualization, conversion, and planning commands;
- independent active-step (`--max-steps`) and total CPU (`--max-cpus`) limits;
- memory- and named-resource-aware concurrent execution;
- nested cgroup-v2 containment with explicit unboxed opt-outs;
- profile feedback, parallel-speedup sweeps, and stress copies; and
- durable, collision-free CPU reservation for benchmark runs.

## Install

```sh
cargo install dagrun
```

Rust 1.85 or newer is required.

The crate installs the `dagrun` and `cpuset-alloc` binaries. Add it as a
library dependency when the model or planning engine belongs inside an
application:

```toml
[dependencies]
dagrun = "0.15"
```

## Rust API

The crate exports the model, strict serializers, planner, scheduler, and
visualization helpers:

```rust
use dagrun::{dag_from_yaml, to_ascii};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let dag = dag_from_yaml("steps: []")?;
    println!("{}", to_ascii(&dag, None));
    Ok(())
}
```

`run_dag(..., combined_limit)` keeps a compatibility combined setting: that
number bounds active steps and caps each runner-controlled step's width. Call
`run_dag_limited(..., max_steps, max_cpus, ...)` (or the corresponding boxed
limited helper) when those limits differ. `cap_config_max_cpus` exposes the same
per-step capping policy for runner-controlled commands. It deliberately
leaves a self-managed fixed width unchanged; the run helpers then reject it if
it exceeds `max_cpus`. Library helpers do not establish an outer scope, so
`max_cpus` is a whole-run bandwidth cap only when the caller supplies equivalent
outer containment; it does not serialize steps whose declared widths sum above
that value.

For Rust harnesses, cargo-nextest supplies libtest's `--exact TEST` arguments,
so the process snapshot can bind each child to its test. Ordinary `cargo test`
runs several tests inside one shared binary; its process tree alone does not
identify the live test and remains explicitly unattributed.

For receipt-bearing validation, set `DAGRUN_REQUIRE_STRUCTURED_TEST_COUNTS=1`.
The runner then exports a scheduler-owned `DAGRUN_TEST_COUNTS_PATH` to each
step and does not derive functional counts from human-readable output. A
controlled test framework writes exactly one JSON object to that path:

```json
{"schema":1,"executed_tests":23,"filtered_tests":5}
```

A missing or malformed file leaves both counts unknown. Printing a line that
looks like a libtest summary cannot create receipt evidence in this mode.

`resource_caps` apply within one runner process by default. To apply the same
capacities across independent runners, pass `run --resource-caps-path FILE`.
`DAGRUN_RESOURCE_CAPS_PATH=FILE` is the secondary route for launchers where a
flag is hard to add; the flag wins when both are present. A run using the file
prints its path before any node starts. With neither input, no shared file is
read and enforcement remains process-local.

`FILE` must already exist, be a regular file owned by the effective user, have
one hard link, and be readable and writable. A missing configured file is an
error; dagrun does not create an empty state and pretend global caps are active.
Create an empty file before starting any runners:

```sh
umask 077
printf '%s\n' '{"next_ticket":0,"requests":[]}' > /absolute/path/resource-caps.json
dagrun run --dag pipeline.yaml \
  --resource-caps-path /absolute/path/resource-caps.json
```

The current JSON schema is one object with these fields:

```json
{
  "next_ticket": 2,
  "requests": [
    {
      "pid": 1234,
      "starttime": 987654,
      "request": "1234-987654-1",
      "tag": "build.app",
      "ticket": 1,
      "state": "waiting",
      "resources": {
        "browser": {"demand": 1, "capacity": 2}
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`next_ticket`, `pid`, `starttime`, and `ticket` are non-negative JSON integers,
except that `pid` and `starttime` must be positive. Request and tag values are
non-empty strings. State is `waiting` or `held`. `resources` is a non-empty
object whose names are non-empty strings; every demand and capacity is a
positive integer, demand must not exceed capacity, and live requests for one
resource must record the same capacity. Request values and ticket values are
unique, and each ticket is less than `next_ticket`.

The file currently has no schema version, boot identity, run identity, or
timestamp. The process start time protects against PID reuse during one boot,
but the file cannot distinguish a stale record from a later boot if the PID and
start time happen to match. The request string is derived from PID, process
start time, and ticket; it identifies a request, not a run. Those omissions,
the strict ticket ordering, and the choice of machine-wide capacities must be
resolved before this should be treated as a generally trustworthy host policy.

This is a repairable design, not one that needs replacement. A next schema
should carry a schema version, the host boot identity, the dagrun run identity,
and the times at which each request was written and granted. The reader should
refuse versions it does not understand, and records from a different boot
should not consume current capacity. The run identity and times should make it
possible to connect a ledger record to the run that produced it and to explain
how long it waited. The machine policy must also establish the capacities used
by every participating runner. Finally, ticket ordering should be revised so a
request that cannot yet fit does not leave otherwise usable capacity idle. The
current locking, atomic file replacement, strict parsing, and process start-time
checks remain useful parts of that repair.

The environment-only implementation that preceded the flag was invisible in
`--help` and startup output. It also treated an absent configured file as an
empty state. Both behaviors made it impossible to tell whether global caps were
actually in effect. The current interface exposes the opt-in and refuses the
missing file. A waiting step does not start its wall or CPU timer until every
requested capacity is granted, and child commands do not inherit the path
because they are already inside the outer step's grant. Malformed state and
conflicting capacities refuse before a node starts.

## Quick start

Save this as `pipeline.yaml`:

```yaml
steps:
  - group: build
    job: app
    desc: compile the application
    cmd: make build
  - group: test
    job: unit
    desc: run unit tests
    cmd: make test
    deps: [build.app]
```

Inspect and run it:

```sh
dagrun ascii --dag pipeline.yaml
dagrun run --dag pipeline.yaml
```

Containment is required by default. On a machine where cgroup-v2 delegation is
intentionally unavailable, add `--allow-cgroup-failure` to accept a visibly
unboxed run.

A `run` launched from one of another run's steps is refused and names the outer
run. Use `--allow-unwise-nest-dagruns` only for a reviewed temporary exception;
prefer flattening the caller into one DAG.

Useful discovery commands:

```sh
dagrun quickstart
dagrun --help
dagrun --userguide
dagrun capabilities
```

For example, `run -s2 -j200` permits at most two active DAG nodes while setting
the whole run's total CPU-bandwidth budget and each runner-controlled step's
maximum inner width to 200 core-equivalents. The two active steps may request
more than 200 workers in aggregate: the verified outer `cpu.max` makes them
share 200 core-equivalents instead of treating declared widths as reservations.
That quota is not an instantaneous thread-count or CPU-identity bound; use
`--cores K` for an exclusive fixed cpuset. Drop the `-s2` and the same command
permits **two hundred** active nodes: an absent `--max-steps` defaults to the
resolved `--max-cpus`, so a bandwidth number you type is also a concurrency
number unless you say otherwise. The long
spelling of `-j` is `--max-cpus`; migrate the 0.13 `run --jobs` spelling to it.
A hidden compatibility alias keeps existing 0.13 scripts working but is not
public run vocabulary; differing simultaneous values conflict and are rejected.
`sweep --jobs RANGE` remains the width-range option for a single-step speedup
experiment. `sweep --target-time 10m` instead walks one node at a time
in stable topological order and completes as many whole cumulative passes as
fit the soft allowance. Pass 1 always finishes; later passes bisect the existing
width gaps and rerun the retained anchor widths. `--step` and `--jobs` are
optional limits in target mode. Because widths and passes deliberately rerun a
node in the same working tree, benchmark commands must be repeatable (or the
caller must restore their inputs and outputs between invocations). A known step `cmdtype` supplies the runner's
exact width arguments; a simple command receives them at the end, while a
compound command puts an unquoted `$DAGRUN_EXTRA_ARGS` where they belong. A
compound command without that placement is refused. `-j3` is one shell word;
`--jobs 3` is two, and quoting the variable would turn those two arguments into
one, so dagrun refuses that double-quoted multi-word form; single quotes prevent
expansion and are also refused. The valid values are `unknown` (default),
`make`, `cargo-build`, `cargo-test`, `cargo-nextest`,
`generic-dash-j-command`, and `generic-with-flag`. The last requires a
step-level `jobs_flag`. Under `unknown`, `DAGRUN_EXTRA_ARGS` is absent and the
existing `jobs_flag`/`jobs_env` rules apply. `default_jobs_env` supplies the
environment channel inherited by steps, and `DAGRUN_JOBS_ENV` supplies that
default when the document omits it. Empty effective channels prevent rewriting.
When paired with a positive declared width, that width is self-managed and the
run refuses it if it exceeds the total budget.

Greedy-LPT and critical-path choose only dispatch order. CPA chooses per-step
widths from isolated speedup curves and checks the largest dependency/resource-
reachable memory footprint. With `--max-mem`, it compares each feasible overlap
ceiling down to serial execution and selects the widths/overlap with the smallest
no-overcommit modeled makespan. It does not model how co-running work changes
either curve; its reference makespan explains allocation, while the live runtime
may oversubscribe the outer CPU quota.

Runs and sweeps auto-append raw CSV measurements to `./.dagrun/profiles/`
relative to the current directory. `--perf-dir` overrides that location,
`DAGRUN_PROFILE_DIR` is the secondary override, and `--no-profile` disables
writes; the command always reports the files it appended. The raw store, not
the authored DAG, is the source of learned scaling data. Every successful
profiling-enabled sweep atomically refreshes a deterministic machine/container-specific
`scaling_model_*.json` sidecar beside it; that cache can be rebuilt at any time.
Sweep rows and the sidecar carry a command-shape digest, and summaries retain
separate reservoirs per digest, so identified old command data is never mixed
into the current curve (blank pre-digest rows are a compatibility fallback only).
Its economic plateau is the narrowest measured width within 10% of the best
eligible wall time, normally excluding widths that
consume more than 1.5x the baseline CPU seconds. CPA uses measured CPU seconds
for work area when present (`p * wall` otherwise) and trusts an exact-width
memory peak only after three uncensored samples at that width; capped peaks are
retained as lower bounds.

## Attributable test-runner timeouts

A DAG node can contain a parallel test runner. On a node timeout, `dagrun`
first freezes durable test and process evidence, sends `SIGTERM` so the inner
runner can flush its state, waits a bounded grace, and only then escalates to
cgroup-wide/process-group `SIGKILL`.

Use three strictly nested bounds: the test runner's per-test timeout below the
DAG step timeout, and the step timeout below the whole-DAG timeout. The
innermost bound produces the clearest named failure. The DAG's process snapshot
is a backstop for a missing or mis-sized runner-native timeout, not a substitute
for one.

For a controlled harness, emit explicit boundaries as work starts and ends:

```text
##TEST-START suite::case
##TEST-END suite::case PASS
```

Several tests may be live concurrently. The timeout report lists the complete
live set and elapsed time for each; the longest-running is labelled only as the
*likely* culprit when more than one remains. Set
`DAGRUN_LOG_DIR` to retain the incrementally flushed per-step log
and `journal.jsonl` even if an outer supervisor later kills the runner.

For third-party runners, the pre-signal `/proc` snapshot reports CPU-burning
and wall-stalled processes as distinct signatures. It binds a process to a
test only when argv supplies a direct test identifier. A one-process-per-test
runner can therefore be bound; a shared-process runner cannot. Without a
direct identifier or recognized output boundaries, the report says
attribution is unavailable rather than guessing.

## CPU-set companion

The distribution also installs `cpuset-alloc`. It reserves disjoint cores in a
durable cross-process ledger and launches a command in a mutation-verified
`AllowedCPUs` cgroup scope. It refuses to run when hard tree-wide pinning cannot
be proved:

```sh
cpuset-alloc run --cores 2 --tag benchmark -- ./benchmark
cpuset-alloc status
cpuset-alloc reclaim
```

`dagrun pin-run` provides the same hard reservation path from the main
command. `run --cores K` applies an exact cpuset only inside the runner's own
managed scope; it is incompatible with an unboxed opt-out. These commands never
fall back to an escapable process-affinity mask. All release live reservations
on exit and reclaim dead holders.
