"""PURE fusion: combine the conflict graph + CI verdicts + freshness + priority into a landing PLAN.

This is the missing fusion the predecessor tools never did: neither the conflict-graph tools nor the
CI-health tool ever computed "these PRs are conflict-free, all green, all fresh — land them now,
these reds are benign, refire them, this one is a real regression, hold it." :func:`compute_plan`
does exactly that, deterministically, from already-collected data.

Per-PR action assignment (the fusion table):

* held (base-conflict)          -> ``rebase-then-land``
* held (draft / depends-on-held)-> ``wait``
* gate-policy change            -> ``escalate-gate-policy``
* exact-head local evidence     -> ``land-now`` (or rebase first), without a merge-gate wait
* CI runner-outage              -> ``escalate-runner-outage``
* CI evaluate-once race         -> ``wait`` (benign; treat as pending)
* CI stale required check       -> ``refire-stale-gate``
* CI flaky red                  -> ``refire-ci``
* CI real red                   -> ``hold-fix``
* CI pending / no checks        -> ``wait``
* CI green but behind base      -> ``rebase-then-land``
* CI green, fresh, gate ok      -> ``land-now``

Ordering among actionable PRs follows the parallel-safe layering, which itself ranks by
priority -> diff size -> age -> PR number.
