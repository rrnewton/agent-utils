"""PURE graph algorithms over pre-collected PRs and edges — no network, no git, no I/O.

The collection layer (:mod:`pr_landing_planner.collect`, which drives a
:class:`pr_landing_planner.host.VcsHost`) produces the nodes and the raw conflict / overlap /
ordering edges. Everything in THIS module is a deterministic function of that data, so it is directly
unit-testable and is the byte-stable target a future Rust port would cross-check:

* file-overlap edges + the file-overlap conflict FALLBACK (used when merge-tree is disabled),
* base-ref (explicit stacking) ordering edges,
* transitive reduction of the ordering DAG + stack extraction,
* held-PR reasoning (draft / base-conflict / depends-on-held, propagated transitively),
* the parallel-safe partition: a greedy independent-set layering over the real conflict graph that
  respects ordering edges (our affordable, static-analysis version of bors batching / Zuul parallel
  states).
