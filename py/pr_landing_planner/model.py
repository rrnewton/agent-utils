"""Core vocabulary for pr-landing-planner: pure data + enums, no I/O.

A landing planner answers one question over a set of open pull requests (PRs): *given the conflict
graph and live CI health, which PRs can be landed now, which must be rebased first, which reds are
real vs. benign, and in what order should the coordinator act?*

Everything here is a frozen dataclass or an :class:`enum.Enum`. The interesting work
(:mod:`pr_landing_planner.graph`, :mod:`pr_landing_planner.classify`, :mod:`pr_landing_planner.plan`,
:mod:`pr_landing_planner.emit`) is PURE and operates on these values, so it is unit-testable with a
:class:`pr_landing_planner.fakehost.FakeHost` and byte-stable for a future Rust port. The two
side-effecting boundaries (talking to a VCS host, running git) live behind the
:class:`pr_landing_planner.host.VcsHost` protocol.
