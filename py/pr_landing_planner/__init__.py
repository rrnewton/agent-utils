"""pr-landing-planner: a conflict-graph + CI-aware, advisory PR-landing planner.

Collect the open pull requests targeting a base branch, build the real merge-conflict graph (via
``git merge-tree``, with a file-overlap fallback), classify each red CI into one of five failure
modes (real / flaky / stale-required-check / evaluate-once-race / runner-outage), apply exact-head
validation evidence and policy disposition, surface mechanism overlaps, compute freshness and holds,
partition into parallel-safe groups, and assign each PR a recommended action. It is ADVISORY ONLY —
it recommends actions and never mutates a pull request.

The pure core (:mod:`pr_landing_planner.graph` / ``classify`` / ``plan`` / ``emit``) operates on
already-collected data and is unit-testable with :class:`pr_landing_planner.fakehost.FakeHost`; the
only side-effecting boundary is the :class:`pr_landing_planner.host.VcsHost` protocol, implemented by
:class:`pr_landing_planner.githubhost.GitHubHost` (``gh`` + ``git``).

    from pr_landing_planner.plan import assemble_result
    from pr_landing_planner.emit import render_human
    host, repo, base = FakeHost.from_fixture(load_fixture_text(text, as_yaml=True))
    result = assemble_result(collect_graph(host, repo=repo, base=base))
    print(render_human(result))
