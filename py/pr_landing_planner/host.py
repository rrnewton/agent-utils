"""The VCS-host seam: everything the planner touches the outside world through.

The pure core (:mod:`pr_landing_planner.graph` / ``classify`` / ``plan`` / ``emit``) never talks to a
host; the collector (:mod:`pr_landing_planner.collect`) drives one :class:`VcsHost`. Only three
operations are truly host-specific — listing open PRs, and (carried ON the returned
:class:`~pr_landing_planner.model.RawPr`) each PR's check rollup + labels. The conflict / ancestry /
freshness operations are plain Git and work against any clone, so they live on the same protocol but
have identical semantics for every host.

We ship one real implementation, :class:`pr_landing_planner.githubhost.GitHubHost` (``gh`` + ``git``,
honoring a ``--net-wrapper`` and ``--gh-cmd``), plus :class:`pr_landing_planner.fakehost.FakeHost`
for deterministic, network-free tests and the runnable demo. A GitLab / Gerrit host would implement
this same protocol.
