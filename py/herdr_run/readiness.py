"""Decide whether a pane is safe to type a command into.

This is the dangerous part of the tool, so it is built out of two INDEPENDENT signals that must
agree, and it fails closed.

**Primary — the foreground process group (an observable, not a proxy).** ``herdr pane
process-info`` reports the pane's ``shell_pid`` and its ``foreground_process_group_id``. When the
shell is at its prompt, the foreground process group IS the shell: the pgid equals the shell pid and
the only foreground process is the shell itself. When anything is running, the kernel has moved the
foreground group to the job. This dereferences the actual running process rather than inferring
liveness from what the screen looks like, so it does not care about prompt themes, colour, spinners,
or how a TUI happens to redraw.

**Secondary — the prompt tail (a veto, never an authority).** The process signal cannot see a
command a human TYPED without pressing Enter: the shell is genuinely idle, yet typing into that
pane would concatenate our command onto their half-written line. So we also look at the last
rendered line. We infer the prompt's trailing literal from the shell rc file (for a ``PS1`` ending
``...\\n\\$ `` the tail is ``"$ "``), then:

* last line ends with the tail            -> ``clean``
* tail occurs earlier in the line         -> ``dirty``  (something is typed after the prompt)
* tail not found, or could not be inferred -> ``abstain``

``abstain`` is honest rather than optimistic: this signal only ever VETOES on positive evidence of
dirt, and never upgrades a pane to ready on its own. If it could not understand the prompt it says
so, and the record shows ``prompt=abstain`` instead of implying a check that did not happen.

A pane is READY only when the process signal says idle and the prompt signal does not veto — and,
because a command being launched has a brief window where the pgid has not moved yet, the process
signal must hold for two consecutive polls.
