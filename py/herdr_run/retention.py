"""Bounded retention for the run spool: delete completed runs older than the retention window.

Two deliberate choices.

**Pruned ON WRITE, not on a timer.** A scheduled job that silently stops running is indistinguishable
from one that runs and finds nothing to do, and that inert-guard failure is exactly the class this
repository keeps rediscovering. Pruning as a side effect of creating a new run means retention can
only lapse if the tool itself stops being used -- in which case nothing is accumulating either.

**Scoped by construction, not by care.** This module DELETES DIRECTORIES, so the scope is enforced
rather than trusted: only entries whose real path's parent is exactly the resolved runs root are
considered, symlinks are skipped outright rather than followed, and the runs root itself is never
removed. Nothing above the capture root is reachable from here even if a caller passes a hostile
spool path.

The audit log is deliberately NOT pruned. It is the best-effort operational record of attempts to
cross the sandbox boundary, it is small, and an evidence trail that quietly deletes itself would
be misleading.
