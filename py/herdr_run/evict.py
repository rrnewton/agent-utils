"""Least-recently-used replacement of idle tabs once a workspace reaches ``max_panes``.

A new agent that needs a tab in a full workspace no longer has to wait for somebody to close one by
hand. Instead the tab whose last recorded ``herdr-run`` run is OLDEST is closed, provided its shell
is provably idle, and the new tab takes its place.

"Provably idle" is deliberately narrower than "looks quiet":

* no other ``herdr-run`` holds the pane's lock (the runner holds it for a whole command);
* the shell alone owns the terminal's foreground process group (:func:`assess_process`);
* the shell leads its own session and NO other process is in that session, so a background job
  (``cmd &``) or a stopped job keeps the tab open;
* the tab holds exactly one pane, because closing a tab closes every pane in it.

The verdict is taken under the pane lock, immediately before ``tab close``, never from an earlier
survey. When ``/proc`` cannot be read the tab counts as busy: failing closed only costs a refusal,
failing open would kill somebody's command. One window remains, and it is harmless: a caller that
resolved its target before the close, and takes the pane lock after it, finds the pane gone and
fails its readiness check before anything is typed.

Order comes from the run spool. Panes with no record at all -- tabs nobody has used through
``herdr-run``, including leaked ones ``reap`` cannot judge -- come first, in listing order.
