"""Execute an admitted command in a pane and collect its real stdout, stderr, and exit code.

**Results are read from FILES, never scraped from the terminal.** The filesystem is shared across
the sandbox boundary, so the pane can redirect into a spool directory this process reads directly.
Scraping would inherit every terminal problem at once — an 80-column pane hard-wraps output
mid-token, the scrollback is finite so long output is silently truncated, ANSI and progress bars
corrupt the text, and there is no exit code anywhere on screen. The wrapper is::

    { cd <cwd> && <command> ; } >stdout 2>stderr; printf '%s\\n' "$?" >exit_code

so ``exit_code`` appearing is both the completion signal and the result, and a failed ``cd`` is
reported as a failure of the run rather than silently running in the wrong directory.

Because ``exit_code`` is written by a separate command after the redirection closes, its EXISTENCE
is what marks completion — but a file can exist while still being written, so a read that does not
parse as an integer is treated as an incomplete write rather than as a corrupt result.
