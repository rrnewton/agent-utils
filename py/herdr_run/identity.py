"""Bind a process id to the boot and start tick that make it *that* process.

A bare PID is not an identity. Linux recycles process numbers, so ``kill(pid, 0)`` answers "is
SOMETHING alive with this number", which is the wrong question in both directions: a recycled
number makes an unrelated stranger look like proof of liveness, and a same-numbered stranger makes
a dead process look alive. :mod:`herdr_run.reap` therefore refuses to act on a PID alone and
requires the triple ``(pid, boot_id, start_ticks)``.

``start_ticks`` is field 22 of ``/proc/<pid>/stat`` — the process's start time in clock ticks since
boot. It is assigned by the kernel at fork and never changes, so two processes that ever held the
same number differ in it. ``boot_id`` scopes that tick count: after a reboot the counter restarts,
so ticks alone would let a pre-reboot record match a post-reboot process.

**Parsing ``/proc/<pid>/stat`` needs care.** Field 2 is the executable name in parentheses and may
itself contain spaces AND parentheses — ``(my prog (v2))`` is a legal comm. Splitting the line on
whitespace therefore mis-numbers every later field. The only correct split is at the LAST ``)``,
after which the remaining whitespace-separated tokens are fields 3 onwards.

Every function here answers "unknown" rather than guessing. An unreadable ``/proc`` must reach the
policy as UNKNOWN, never as "the process is gone", because the second reading authorises closing a
tab and the first does not.
