"""Reaping policy for stale herdr tabs.

Agents are coined and destroyed continuously, and every one that ever ran a command through
``herdr-run`` leaves a tab behind. This module decides which of those tabs are *provably* finished
with, so they can be closed, and -- much more importantly -- which ones must be left alone.

WHY THE OBVIOUS SIGNALS DO NOT WORK
-----------------------------------
herdr exposes no tab creation time and no last-activity time. ``PaneInfo.revision`` looks like an
activity counter and is not: it counts pane *metadata* revisions, and stays put while the terminal
produces visible output. So there is no "last used" field to threshold on.

Worse, the tempting substitute -- "no output for N minutes" -- cannot work even in principle here.
A *finished* agent and a *dead* agent are identical on the silence axis. Any absence-of-output
detector conflates them, and the expensive direction of that mistake is killing an agent that is
merely thinking.

WHY THE RUN-DIRECTORY PID IS THE WRONG ANCHOR (measured, not assumed)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The run spool is ``.herdr-run/runs/<utc>-<agent>-<pid>/``, and it is tempting to read that trailing
PID as "the process that owns this tab" and treat its death as evidence of staleness. **That PID is
the short-lived ``herdr-run`` CLI invocation, not the agent and not the pane.** It exits the moment
the command finishes, so it is dead by construction for every completed run.

Measured on the live spool (15 run directories, 2026-08-06): the run-directory PID was dead for
**15 of 15**, while the pane shell recorded in the same ``meta.json`` was alive for **15 of 15**.
A policy anchored on the run-directory PID would therefore have classified every tab whose commands
had all finished -- which is every healthy idle agent -- as stale, and reaped the entire workspace.

The correct anchor is the **pane's shell process**, which is what actually owns the tab.

THE PREDICATE
-------------
A tab is STALE only when all of these hold, each positive evidence rather than absence:

* **R1 no in-flight work.** Every run naming this pane recorded an ``exit_code``. A run with no
  recorded exit code is IN FLIGHT -- that is the "agent is thinking" case, and it is positively
  distinguishable from a finished one rather than being inferred from silence. The state is
  written by exactly one place: :func:`herdr_run.runner.execute` records the run with a null exit
  code when collection times out, because the command is then still running in a pane this process
  does not own. That is the whole reason the rule exists, and until the timeout path recorded
  anything the rule was unreachable -- documented as a protection while no writer could produce the
  state it tests for. :func:`herdr_run.sweep.load_run_records` re-reads the run's ``exit_code``
  file afterwards, so a command that finished after we stopped waiting stops looking in flight.
* **R2 the pane's shell is gone.** Not the run-directory PID; the shell PID.
* **R3 reboot and PID reuse are excluded.** ``kill(pid, 0)`` alone is not sufficient on a busy
  host: a recycled PID makes an unrelated live process look like proof of liveness, and a
  same-numbered stranger look like proof of death. Identity is bound as
  ``(pid, boot_id, start_ticks)`` -- field 22 of ``/proc/<pid>/stat`` -- which is the shape
  needed to distinguish a process from a recycled number. The recorded boot must also match the
  current boot before absence of the old PID can authorize anything.

Anything else -- unreadable ``/proc``, missing ``meta.json``, absent ``pane_id``, a boot-id
mismatch, a pane herdr does not know about -- is UNKNOWN, and unknown is never reaped. The cost
asymmetry is the whole reason: killing an agent mid-work is far worse than clutter, and a reaper
that is wrong once in the expensive direction gets switched off permanently.

SCOPE IS ENFORCED, NOT TRUSTED
------------------------------
Only panes belonging to tabs in *our* workspace, whose labels match the configured tab schema, are
even considered. A tab a human opened by hand, or another tool's workspace, is not a candidate no
matter how idle it looks.

REPORT-ONLY BY DEFAULT
----------------------
``plan_reap`` decides; it never closes anything. Closing is a separate, explicit step. A reaper that
is trusted before it has been checked against a known-good population is how the whole workspace
gets deleted once.

This module holds no I/O. Evidence is passed in, so the policy is testable without a live herdr and
without waiting for real processes to die -- and so the planted-stale and planted-live cases can
both be exercised deterministically.
