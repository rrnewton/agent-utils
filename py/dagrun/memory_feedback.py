"""Turn persisted per-step profiles into memory-admission estimates, conservatively.

The profile store records what each step's cgroup peaked at. It does NOT follow that the peak
is what the step wanted: a step whose ``peak_bytes`` equals the ``memory.max`` that was applied
to it used everything it was allowed, and a step the kernel killed at that ceiling wanted
strictly more. Both are CENSORED observations. Fitting a cap to them ratchets the cap down to
whatever it already was and freezes the mistake, which is why the default planner feedback in
:mod:`dagrun.estimates` is left alone and this is a separate, opt-in path a caller
must ask for by name.

The rules here are the ones a caller can rely on:

* A censored sample never lowers anything. It is used only as a FLOOR — proof that demand was
  at least that large — never as an estimate of the maximum.
* A row that records a step which FAILED is censored too. A step that did not finish its work
  stopped somewhere short of where it was going, and ``returncode`` 137 — SIGKILL — is exactly
  what an ancestor-scope OOM kill looks like from inside this reader.
* A sample whose censoring cannot be determined (no applied-cap column, no event counters, no
  peak) is not evidence at all. It is counted and reported, and it never moves the estimate.
* With no uncensored evidence, no estimate is made and the reason says which of the three ways
  the evidence failed. That is a decline, not amnesia: the largest peak the step is proven to
  have reached still applies as a floor, so a declined step is modelled at the LARGER of its
  authored hint and that floor. "We do not know the peak" and "we know the peak is at least X"
  are different states and must not collapse into "we know nothing".
* ``hard_mem_max_bytes`` is never touched. An explicit hard cap is an instruction, not a guess.

Every estimate carries its own provenance — the sample counts by verdict, the percentile, the
margin, and the floor — so a plan can show why a number moved or why it did not.

The columns this reads are the ones the writer records per step; see
:data:`dagrun.perflog.CENSORING_COLUMNS`.

    which is turning the flag on to get a SMALLER number than the evidence proves: the same
