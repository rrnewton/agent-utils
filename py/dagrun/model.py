#: Wall-clock backstop (seconds) for a step that declares NO wall budget AND no CPU budget to
#: derive one from. Wall time is LOAD-DEPENDENT, so it is only a defence-in-depth hang backstop;
#: the CPU-time budget is the real, load-immune guard.
DEFAULT_STEP_TIMEOUT = 1800

#: When a step declares a CPU-second budget but no wall budget, the wall backstop is derived at
#: this multiple of the (platform-scaled) CPU budget. A step legitimately spending C CPU-seconds
#: can take up to ~C wall-seconds when serialized on one core, plus scheduling slack under load;
#: 3x leaves generous headroom so the wall guard only ever fires on a true hang and never races
#: the authoritative CPU-second guard.
#:
#: That reasoning holds for CPU-BOUND work only, which is why :func:`resolved_wall_timeout` floors
#: the derived value at :data:`DEFAULT_STEP_TIMEOUT` and never uses it to tighten a step: a step
#: that blocks on the network or a lock spends almost no CPU and arbitrary wall time.
#:
#: The value and the name are DELIBERATELY the same as
#: ``parallel_experiment_runner.model.WALL_CPU_BACKSTOP_FACTOR``, which established this idiom in
#: this repository. One policy, spelled once per project rather than invented twice;
#: ``test_wall_timeout_derivation.py`` asserts the two constants are equal so they cannot drift.
WALL_CPU_BACKSTOP_FACTOR = 3

#: Deliberately SMALL default caps for a step that DECLARES NOTHING — the "forcing function".
#: An undeclared step is boxed into a tight 1-core / 1-GiB / 10-s-CPU floor, so a real step
#: immediately hits the cap and must DECLARE its true needs. That generates per-node resource
#: metadata EMPIRICALLY (from measured breaches) instead of by guessing. Each default applies
#: ONLY when the step leaves the matching hint unset; an explicit hint always wins. They are
#: DagConfig fields (below), so any caller can override or disable a dimension.
DEFAULT_SMALL_MEM_CAP_BYTES = 1024**3  # 1 GiB inner memory.max when no memory hint is declared
DEFAULT_SMALL_CPU_COUNT = 1  # 1-core cpu.max when no inner-parallelism width is declared
DEFAULT_SMALL_CPU_TIMEOUT = 10  # 10 s CPU-time budget when cpu_timeout is unset

#: Per-platform CPU-budget multiplier, applied at EXECUTION time to whatever CPU budget is in
#: effect for a step. A CPU second is load-immune (wall = cpu_busy + wait; contention inflates
#: only wait) but it is NOT clock-immune: a slower core retires the same instruction stream over
#: more seconds of CPU occupancy, so identical work legitimately burns more CPU-seconds on an
#: underpowered runner. A graph therefore carries ONE canonical `cpu_timeout` per step and the
#: platform scales it here.
#:
#: Applying it at execution — rather than baking a second column of pre-multiplied numbers into
#: the graph — is the whole point: two independently-maintained timeout tables drift, and a step
#: has only one `cpu_timeout` field, so a per-platform column would force declaration authors to
#: pick a single number that is either too tight for the slow platform or too loose for the fast
#: one (hiding the very hangs the budget exists to catch).
#:
#: 1.0 is a strict no-op: unset, every platform enforces the canonical budget exactly as before.
#: A platform opts in explicitly (`--cpu-timeout-multiplier`, or $DAGRUN_CPU_TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER
#: in a lane's environment), and every breach message then states the canonical budget, the
#: multiplier and the platform label, so a kill stays attributable to a specific policy rather
#: than to an anonymous number.
DEFAULT_CPU_TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER = 1.0

#: Environment override for :data:`DEFAULT_CPU_TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER`, so a CI lane can set the
#: policy once for its whole platform without threading a flag through every invocation.
CPU_TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER_ENV = "DAGRUN_CPU_TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER"

#: Companion label naming the platform the multiplier describes. Free-form (e.g.
#: "github-hosted"); it appears verbatim in the breach message so the reader can find the lane
#: that set it. Empty when the multiplier is 1.0 or the caller supplied no label.
CPU_TIMEOUT_PLATFORM_ENV = "DAGRUN_CPU_TIMEOUT_PLATFORM"

#: Default template for the inner-parallelism (concurrency) flag appended to a step's command

DEFAULT_JOBS_FLAG = "-j"

#: MACHINE-LEVEL name of the environment variable through which this host delivers a step's
#: inner width, for guests that read their worker count from the environment rather than argv
#: (cargo's ``CARGO_BUILD_JOBS`` is the motivating case).
#:
#: WHY THIS IS A MACHINE KNOB AND NOT A GRAPH FIELD. How many workers a step should use is a
#: property of the HOST; *which channel* a tool listens on is a property of the toolchain
#: INSTALLED on that host. Neither is a property of the work, so neither belongs in a DAG. This
#: mirrors :data:`CPU_TIMEOUT_PLATFORM_ENV`, which already scales a graph-declared budget per
#: platform without editing the graph.
#:
#: It exists because an appended flag cannot reach every guest: a step whose command is a
#: compound ``A && B`` would have the flag land only on ``B``, and a command ending in ``--``
#: would pass it through to a program that has no such option. Those steps carry an empty
#: ``jobs_flag`` today and are consequently unresizable, which makes the runner refuse them on
#: any host too small for their declared width.

    Precedence, most specific first:

    1. the step's own ``timeout`` (>0) — an explicit author decision always wins;
    2. the document's ``default_step_timeout`` (>0) — an explicit document-wide decision;
    3. ``WALL_CPU_BACKSTOP_FACTOR`` x the step's PLATFORM-SCALED ``cpu_timeout``, when the step
       DECLARED one AND that is LARGER than :data:`DEFAULT_STEP_TIMEOUT`;
    4. :data:`DEFAULT_STEP_TIMEOUT`.

    *THE DERIVATION ONLY EVER LOOSENS.* Rule 3 is floored at :data:`DEFAULT_STEP_TIMEOUT`, so no
    step that ran under 1800 s before this rule existed runs under less now. Without that floor
    the rule silently retimed every already-authored step that declared a CPU budget: a
    ``networkonly`` step ``{"cmd": "git fetch ...", "cpu_timeout": 5}`` burns ~5 CPU-seconds and
    blocks for minutes on the network, and a 15-second ceiling SIGTERMs it and reports a hang.
    Wall time is unbounded relative to CPU time for anything that blocks, so a CPU-derived
    ceiling is only sound as an UPPER bound. The direction the derivation is for is the other
    one: a step declaring ``cpu_timeout: 900`` had a 1800 s wall ceiling that its own CPU guard
    could reach — at a 2.5x platform multiplier the enforced budget is 2250 s, ABOVE the wall
    bound — so the wall guard fired first and reported a hang where the truth was a slow machine.
    Rule 3 lifts that step to 2700 s and restores the 3x margin.

    Two further choices in rule 3 are deliberate and were the open questions in the design:

    *DECLARED, not canonical.* :func:`canonical_cpu_timeout` fills in the DAG's small default
    (10 s) for a step that declares nothing, and it is ALWAYS in force. Deriving from that would
    hand every undeclared step a 30-second wall ceiling where it currently gets 1800 — a silent,
    enormous tightening applied to exactly the steps whose needs nobody has measured yet. So the
    derivation fires only for a step whose author stated a CPU budget, and everything else falls
    to rule 4 with the behaviour it has always had.

    *SCALED, not canonical.* ``cpu_timeout_multiplier`` exists to loosen the CPU guard on a slow
    platform. A wall backstop pinned to the unscaled number would shrink to 3/multiplier of the
    enforced budget and start racing — firing FIRST on precisely the platform the multiplier was
    added for, and reporting a wall hang where the truth is a slow machine. Tracking the scaled
    budget keeps the 3x ratio wherever the multiplier goes.

    ABSENT IS NOT ZERO, and this is the one place the difference can still be seen.  The
    scheduler's gate reads ``resource_avail.get(name, 0)``, so an undeclared resource and a
    resource deliberately capped at 0 collapse into the same integer and produce byte-identical
    behaviour: the step is never ready, the ready-set loop keeps sleeping, and the run sits at 0%
    CPU emitting nothing until some outer deadline kills it.  Their remedies are opposites —
    "declare the capacity you forgot" versus "this is blocked on purpose" — so a report that
    cannot tell them apart is worse than no report.

    Only a demand GREATER THAN ZERO can starve, and an intentionally-skipped step never launches,
    so neither is named here.  A cap DECLARED as 0 is a real value and is likewise not named: it
    still gates the step, exactly as its author asked.

    Returns ``"<tag>: <resource>"`` entries, sorted, empty when every demand has a declared cap.

    """Ways the GRAPH ITSELF cannot mean what it says, named before anything runs.

    Each entry describes a graph whose declared steps cannot all be executed in the order the
    graph asks for.  None of them is a matter of taste.

    DUPLICATE TAG is the worst of the set, because it is the one that stays SILENT.  Two steps
    declared with the same ``group.job`` collapse into one entry in every ``by_tag`` index the
    runner builds, so exactly one of them ever runs, the other vanishes without a word, and the
    summary still counts both as passed.  A run that reports "2 passed" having executed one
    command is not a partial failure; it is a false report.

    MISSING DEPENDENCY names a predecessor no step declares.  Left to the scheduler this is a
    "terminal starve" discovered only after every unrelated step has already run, so a typo in
    one edge costs a full build before it is reported.

    CYCLE is the crash.  Nothing downstream of the loader tolerates one: the bottom-level walk
    recurses along the cycle until the stack is exhausted, and the critical-path walk never
    reaches a sink.  Those walks are written for an acyclic graph on purpose; this is the check
    that makes that assumption true.  The refusal NAMES the cycle, because "there is a cycle" in
    a 200-node graph is not actionable.

    UNSATISFIABLE RESOURCE DEMAND is a step whose demand exceeds a POSITIVE declared cap, so it
    can never be admitted however long the run waits.  A cap declared as exactly ``0`` is
    deliberately NOT included: ``0`` means "blocked on purpose" (see
    :func:`undeclared_resource_demands`), and a check here would turn that documented affordance
    into a load error.

    Returns human-readable entries in a deterministic order, empty when the graph is sound.
    Duplicate tags SHORT-CIRCUIT the remaining checks: while two steps share a tag, every
    statement about "the step named X" is ambiguous, and reporting edges against an arbitrary
    winner would be guesswork presented as fact.
