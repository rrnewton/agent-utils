"""The enforcement manifest, derived from the guards that implement it, PER LANE.

The ``capabilities`` subcommand advertises which containment guards this engine really
applies. That manifest used to be a hand-typed JSON string literal, which meant it could
claim enforcement that no longer happened: nothing tied the literal to a guard site, so
deleting or short-circuiting a guard left the advertisement intact. The py-vs-rs
differential compares the two manifests byte-for-byte, which stops the two ENGINES from
drifting apart but cannot notice both being wrong together, nor a manifest drifting from
the guard sites inside its own engine.

So the manifest is generated here instead. :data:`ENFORCEMENT_REGISTRY` is the single
declaration; :func:`enforcement_manifest` serializes it key-sorted, compact and with
lowercase booleans, so the two editions agree BY CONSTRUCTION rather than because two
people kept two literals in step; and :func:`is_enforced` is consulted at the guard site
itself, so flipping one flag moves the advertisement AND the behaviour together.

THE MANIFEST IS PER LANE, BECAUSE ENFORCEMENT IS. Most of these guards are implemented by
reading or writing a cgroup, and a run that could not get one (``--allow-cgroup-failure``,
``--unsafe-no-cgroups``, or a library call with no manager) does not have them -- the step
still runs, still exits 0, and is still reported green. A single flat column could only
ever describe one of those two worlds, and it described the boxed one, so an uncontained
run was advertised guards it was not getting: a step declaring ``cpu_timeout: 3`` could
burn 60 CPU-seconds and be reported green while the manifest said the budget held. Each
:class:`Capability` therefore carries TWO flags, ``contained`` and ``uncontained``, and
:func:`is_enforced` takes the :class:`Lane` the run is actually on. The lane is not a
comment about the guard site; it is the argument the guard site passes, so the uncontained
column is load-bearing in exactly the way the contained one is.

:func:`is_enforced` raises on an unknown key. A guard site that misspells its capability
therefore fails loudly at the moment it runs, rather than reading as "not enforced" and
silently switching the guard off -- which is the exact failure this module exists to
prevent.

WHICH KEYS ACTUALLY GATE SOMETHING. Five of the nine are consulted at the code that
enforces them, and their flags are load-bearing on both lanes:

    ==============  ================================================================
    key             guard site that consults ``is_enforced``
    ==============  ================================================================
    cpu_timeout     the scheduler's 1 Hz ``cpu.stat`` monitor, which reaps over budget
    wall_timeout    the scheduler's per-step wait deadline
    oom_detection   the post-step ``memory.events`` ``oom_kill`` read
    memory_max      the per-step inner ``memory.max`` write in the cgroup manager
    pids_guard      the per-step inner ``pids.max`` write in the cgroup manager
    ==============  ================================================================

The remaining four -- ``cpu_affinity``, ``cpu_bandwidth``, ``run_timeout`` and
``write_domains`` -- are declarations only: the registry records them and the manifest
publishes them, but no code consults their flag, so flipping one changes the
advertisement WITHOUT changing behaviour. Wiring those is a further step, and saying so
here is better than implying a coverage that does not exist.
