#: because two neighboring ratios changed. Ten percent gives the intended result for a curve such
#: as 7.2x at 8 threads versus 7.9x at 64: 8 is already within 10% of the best wall while consuming
#: one eighth of the advertised width.
_PLATEAU_WALL_TOLERANCE = 0.10
#: If total CPU-seconds (user+sys) grow by more than this factor relative to the BASELINE width, the
#: point is not an economic plateau candidate. It may remain useful diagnostically (and is retained
#: in the curve), but spending >50% more CPU work for the wall-time gain should not become the
#: default recommendation when other productive work can use the machine.
_SPEEDUP_MAX_WORK_GROWTH = 1.5
#: A step needs at least this many DISTINCT inner_jobs levels (with wall data) to model a curve;
#: fewer and there is nothing to say about speedup vs. parallelism.
_SPEEDUP_MIN_LEVELS = 2

#: it replaces the conservative authored/pooled fallback in allocation.
_MEMORY_MIN_SAMPLES_PER_LEVEL = 3
