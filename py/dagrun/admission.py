"""Host-wide MEMORY admission: grant, queue, or refuse a run before it contends.

WHAT THIS ADDS THAT ``--max-mem`` DOES NOT. ``sizing.box_mem_budget_bytes`` and the ``--max-mem``
refusal in the CLI gate memory at box bring-up: one process, one question, one yes-or-no, answered
against a snapshot of the host. That has no notion of what OTHER runner invocations on the same
host have already committed to, so two boxes started a second apart each see the same headroom and
both take it. Neither is wrong on its own; together they overcommit the machine and the symptom is
swapping or an OOM kill in whichever run happens to touch its pages last.

This module is the missing shared state, and it is deliberately the SIBLING of the core ledger in
:mod:`dagrun.reservation`: a durable, ``flock``-serialized file that every runner on
the host contends on, with dead-holder reclaim fingerprinted by ``(pid, /proc starttime)`` so a
crashed run cannot subtract memory forever and a recycled PID is never mistaken for the original
holder.

THREE ANSWERS, NOT TWO. A yes-or-no can only ever say "no", which tells the caller nothing about
what to do next:

* :attr:`Verdict.GRANT` -- the reservation is recorded and held.
* :attr:`Verdict.QUEUE` -- it would fit on a quiet host, so WAITING CAN HELP. The decision reports
  how many live holders must finish first, and which resource is in the way.
* :attr:`Verdict.REFUSE` -- the request alone exceeds the whole-host budget, so waiting can NEVER
  help however long anyone waits. The decision says the largest number that could be granted, so
  the operator has something to type instead of a closed door.

Collapsing QUEUE into REFUSE turns a transient into a permanent failure; collapsing REFUSE into
QUEUE turns a configuration error into a hang. Both are worse than saying which one it is.

TWO CONDITIONS, EACH NAMED SEPARATELY. A grant requires BOTH:

1. ``reserved + requested <= whole-host budget`` -- the aggregate this tool will ever let itself
   hold, derived from ``MemTotal``. This is the condition other RUNNERS affect.
2. ``requested <= live headroom`` -- ``MemAvailable`` minus the safety margin, re-read on every
   call. This is the condition NON-RUNNER tenants affect: a ledger alone cannot see a database
   that grew, and a budget that ignores the live reading gates nothing on a shared machine.

They are kept apart because the remedies differ: the first waits for a peer run, the second waits
for (or requires action on) something this tool does not manage.

#: leaves an aggregate budget of ZERO: every request is REFUSED, and the refusal helpfully advises
#: asking for "at most 0 B" -- while the live headroom reading is pinned at zero too, so nothing

#: ``Instant + Duration`` and an unbounded seconds value PANICS the process (overflow when adding
#: a duration to an instant) on a number this very function has just accepted. Both editions
