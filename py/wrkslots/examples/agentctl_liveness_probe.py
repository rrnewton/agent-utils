"""Running check for ``wrkslots init`` that asks an agentctl registry whether an agent is alive.

wrkslots calls this as ``PATH AGENT`` during removal and audit. The exit status is the answer:
0 verified dead, 1 alive, 2 unverifiable. Exit 1 counts as alive only when the whole output is one
line naming ``agent=AGENT`` and ``rc=1``, so every outcome prints exactly one such line.

The registry is ``$AGENTCTL_REGISTRY`` when set, else ``$WRKSLOTS_PROJECT_ROOT/.agentctl``: the
registry a coordinator gets by running agentctl from the project root.

A record matches AGENT when its ``name`` is AGENT or its ``name_history`` (written by
``agentctl rename``) contains AGENT, so a renamed agent is still found under the name the slot
recorded. A later agent that reuses the name also matches; any live match counts, which errs
toward keeping the slot.

The check fails closed. It reports dead only when all of these hold:

- no rename journal names AGENT, no active record matches it, and at least one archived record
  does, which agentctl writes only after ``agentctl stop`` retired the runtime it owned;
- no archived record's pinned process identity (PID, kernel start time, and boot ID) is alive;
- no readable process of this user still carries an archived record's Herdr pane in
  ``HERDR_PANE_ID``.

An active record whose pinned process or pane is alive is alive. Anything else, including an
active record with nothing visibly alive behind it, a name agentctl never recorded, or an
unreadable record, is unverifiable: agentctl has not confirmed that the agent stopped.

This is one input to removal, not the whole decision. wrkslots still requires its own census of
processes using the slot, its time-to-live, and its Git and path checks.
