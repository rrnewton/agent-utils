"""Disk-image representation for wrkslots slots.

A slot normally stores its checkouts as ordinary directories on the host file
system. With the image representation, the whole slot directory is instead the
mount point of one sparse ext4 image file. The host sees a handful of files per
slot, whatever the agent writes inside it:

    <control>/slot-images/<slot-type>/<slot>/
        IMAGE.json   representation record (location, backend, ceiling)
        slot.img     sparse ext4 image mounted at the slot directory
        state.img    sparse ext4 image for the sandbox's per-slot private HOME directories
        state/       mount point of state.img

Why this helps: a slot's millions of small build files are metadata inside the
image rather than inside the host file system, a runaway writer fills its own
image instead of the host, and reclaim unmounts and deletes one file instead of
walking a tree.

The representation is a storage choice only. Lifecycle policy (ownership,
heartbeats, salvage, reclaim) is unchanged and lives in ``cli.py``.

Nothing here changes host configuration. Mounting uses either:

* ``kernel``: ``sudo -n mount -o loop`` (fast, needs passwordless sudo), or
* ``fuse``: ``fuse2fs`` as the invoking user (no privilege, slower metadata).

``auto`` picks ``kernel`` when ``sudo -n`` works and falls back to ``fuse``.
Images are sparse and are never pre-reserved: the ceiling is an upper bound on
the file's apparent size, not an allocation. Deleted blocks are returned to the
host (``discard`` for kernel mounts, ``fstrim`` on unmount for FUSE mounts).
