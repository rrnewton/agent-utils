"""Verified prompt submission for terminal agent composers.

A terminal agent accepts a prompt in two separate steps: the text is staged in
its composer, and a submission key moves it into the conversation (or into the
agent's own queue while it is busy). Sending the key is not proof that the
second step happened. An agent can drop a key while it is redrawing or running
its own hooks, and the text then stays in the composer indefinitely.

This module drives both steps against the rendered screen and reports one of
three outcomes:

* nothing was typed (``PromptNotStaged``) -- the prompt is safe to retry;
* the text was staged but never left the composer
  (``PromptStagedNotSubmitted``) -- it is visible and unsubmitted, so it must
  not be typed again automatically;
* the text left the composer and the screen corroborates a submission
  (a ``SubmissionReceipt``).

Any other failure after typing began is ambiguous and is raised as
``HerdrUnavailable``, which callers treat as possibly submitted.
