"""A rebuilt DagConfig must be provably the same configuration, field by field.

``DagConfig(steps=steps)`` — the natural thing to write once a loader hands out steps and keeps
its configuration elsewhere — reverts every top-level field the call does not name.  Nothing
reports it: the reverted fields appear in no diff, no warning, and no failure.  In the incident
that produced this test file, a lane's 600 s wall budget became the 1800 s module default and a
privileged lane's 120 s became 1800 s, a 3x and 15x loosening that produced *no symptom at all*.
The scarce-resource cap dropped the same way and merely happened to fail loudly, by hanging.

So the check cannot be "does it hang".  It is a CARRY ASSERTION: compare the rebuilt config with
the one it came from and name every field that differs.  Both directions are asserted here — a
comparison that reported everything would pass the negative case alone.

The comparison is deliberately not dataclass equality.  ``DAG_CONFIG_FIELDS`` is a written-down
checklist and :func:`dag_config_carry_diff` refuses to run when it drifts from ``DagConfig``, so
a NEW field forces a decision instead of joining a silent default — which is exactly this bug's
shape.  The Rust twin gets the same guarantee from exhaustive destructuring, where the omission
is a compile error.
