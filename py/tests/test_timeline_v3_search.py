"""The schema-3 transcript search corpus, proved equal to the schema-2 one it replaces.

A port of a search corpus is not a feature to spot-check. The two generations are read by the
same `search_v2`, so the only thing that can distinguish them is what
`query.TimelineQuery._iter_search_records` and `_search_link_context` hand it -- and a difference
there is invisible in the shape of the output and visible only in *which* records come back, on
*some* queries. So the contract asserted here is a differential: one corpus, two archives, a
battery of queries, and full equality of the answer.

The battery is built from the failure modes the case study in
`agent_team_timeline/ai_docs/TRANSCRIPT_SEARCH_CASE_STUDY.md` actually recorded, rather than from
the axes of the API:

* its acceptance query, ``backend maturity B3``, and the ``B3`` that motivated it -- two UTF-8
  bytes, so no trigram prefilter can act on it and every selected shard is scanned. Under schema 3
  that query reads no Bloom data at all, which is a different *cost* and must be the same
  *answer*;
* the Unicode trap -- "Unicode case equivalences did not match the ASCII Bloom normalization".
  The Kelvin sign folds to ``k`` under Python's ``re.IGNORECASE`` and does not under the corpus's
  portable ASCII-only rule, so a filter built one way and a matcher compiled the other way would
  prune a shard that holds a match. Both generations must agree, and must agree with the matcher;
* the pruning trap -- "text-shard pruning could hide a previous-day prompt or later-day response".
  A term that appears only on the second day prunes the first day's shard, and the answer still
  has to carry the excerpt of the prompt that lived in the pruned shard;
* ``prompt_in_scope`` -- a sliced export retains a ``prompt_ref`` whose prompt is outside the
  range. It is a field of the record and the port must not quietly drop it;
* the receiver-side Codex return -- a child's final answer recorded on the parent's rollout and
  attributed to the child.

The second archive is the first one with its schema-3 search streams removed, which is exactly
what an archive built before those streams looks like, and it is the reason the comparison is
sound: everything else about the two -- the same records, the same agents, the same phases, the
same digests -- is byte-identical, so a difference in an answer can only have come from the
corpus that answered it.
