"""The manifest is derived from the guards that implement it, PER LANE.

Two defects met here, and the fix is one mechanism.

#79 derived-enforcement-manifest: the ``capabilities`` manifest used to be a hand-typed JSON
literal with nothing tying it to the code that enforces the guards it advertises, so it could
claim enforcement that was not happening. It is now generated from
:data:`dagrun.capabilities.ENFORCEMENT_REGISTRY`, and five of its nine keys are
consulted by :func:`dagrun.capabilities.is_enforced` at the guard site itself.

#75 cpu-timeout-unboxed-fallback: that literal was also one flat object asserting
``"cpu_timeout":true``, and that sentence is true only under cgroup boxing. On an uncontained
lane -- ``--allow-cgroup-failure``, ``--unsafe-no-cgroups``, or a library call with no manager
-- the CPU guard reads ``cpu.stat`` zero times, so a step may burn unbounded CPU against a
declared budget, exit 0, and be reported green while the manifest says the budget was enforced.

So each registry entry carries one flag PER LANE, ``is_enforced`` takes the lane the run is on,
and the manifest publishes both columns. What is pinned here:

* the published bytes, written out LITERALLY -- re-deriving them from the registry would pass no
  matter what the registry said, and a test parametrised over the constant it protects asserts
  nothing;
* each lane's table, likewise written out by hand;
* the behaviour: flip one flag and BOTH the advertisement and the observed guard move, on each
  lane independently; and
* an uncontained run says out loud which guard it is not running, so the degradation is legible
  at the console and not only in a manifest nobody printed.
