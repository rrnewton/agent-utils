"""A suite whose verdict depends on the developer's shell is not a suite.

``select_build_jobs`` consults an operator intent captured from ``$CARGO_BUILD_JOBS`` at import.
That made two pre-existing suites environment-dependent the moment it landed:
``CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=200 python3 -m pytest tests/test_build_job_cap.py tests/test_sizing.py``
reported ``2 failed`` — ``test_unpinned_step_is_bounded_not_284`` and
``test_legitimate_configs_pass_unharmed``, both with a wrapped command carrying
``export CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=200`` where the containment default should have refined the step's width
down to 4. Nothing scrubbed the variable, so ``make validate`` was green or red according to who
ran it.

Asserting "the fixture cleared it" would be worthless here: on a host where the variable is
already unset, such an assertion passes with or without the fixture. So this test creates the
condition itself, in a child interpreter that really has the variable exported, and requires the
affected suites to pass under it.
