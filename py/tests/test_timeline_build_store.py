"""Build state belongs beside the published archive, not inside it.

The archive is shipped to whatever machine serves the site, so everything in it is paid for in
bandwidth and disk on every copy. On the measured archive 717 MiB of the 1.5 GiB was intermediate
state that neither the browser nor the shipped CLI ever opens. These tests pin the relocation and,
more importantly, the two refusals: the ways an archive could end up with its build state split
across two trees are the ways a rebuild silently loses a team.
