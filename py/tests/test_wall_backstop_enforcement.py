"""A DERIVED wall backstop must reach the step that runs, not merely the pure function.

``resolved_wall_timeout`` was pinned by unit tests and by the pre-flight ``--run-timeout``
ordering check, and by nothing else. Replacing the call at the ENFORCEMENT site in
``scheduler.py`` with the pre-derivation fallback (``step.timeout``, else the document default,
else 1800) left every suite in both engines green: a step declaring only a CPU budget went on
running under 1800 s while the docs and the manifest said otherwise. ``make cross`` cannot see
that either, because it is a py-vs-rs differential and the defect is symmetric.

This is the Python half of ``rs/safe-ci-dag-runner/tests/wall_backstop_enforcement.rs``, and it
pins the chain in two links, because a derived ceiling is floored at ``DEFAULT_STEP_TIMEOUT`` and
so cannot be waited out inside a test:

1. a real run of a step that declares only ``cpu_timeout`` journals the DERIVED ceiling as the
   bound it ran under; and
2. the number journalled under that name is the number the wall killer actually enforces — a step
   given a 2-second ceiling is reaped at 2 seconds and reports 2.

Both legs run unboxed, so neither can self-skip: the wall bound is a scheduler ``wait`` with a
deadline and is in force on the uncontained lane, which ``capabilities`` already says out loud.
