// The schema-3 reader out of `static/app.js`, lifted into a Node realm so it can be tested.
//
// `app.js` is one IIFE that starts by resolving DOM nodes, so it cannot be `require`d: the very
// first thing it does on load is fail. The suites in this directory have always answered that by
// slicing named functions out of the source text and running them against a stub `app`, and this
// file is that trick factored out, because two suites now need the same twenty-odd functions --
// `test_timeline_v3_ui.js` against synthetic fixtures, and `schema3_http_probe.js` against a real
// archive served by the real `standalone_server.py`.
//
// The extraction is textual and therefore fragile in one specific way: it depends on this
// repository's formatting, where a top-level function inside the IIFE opens at indent two and
// closes with a line that is exactly two spaces and a brace. That is checked rather than assumed
// -- `assertExtractionIsSound` below re-parses every slice and fails loudly if one of them did not
// come out as a complete function -- so a reformat breaks the suite with a message that says so
// instead of silently testing a truncated body.
