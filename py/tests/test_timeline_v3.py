"""Contract tests for the schema-3 write path.

Four properties carry the whole design, so they are asserted on bytes and on file listings rather
than on the writer's own report:

*Schema 3 loses nothing.* Every schema-1 record comes back out of the shards, byte for byte,
once the two envelope keys are removed. A projection that is 7% of its source is only interesting
if it is still the same records, so that is the first test in the file and the one the rest lean
on.

*A shard exists once.* The defect being removed is 2.42 GB of plain `.json` beside 0.19 GB of
`.gz`, so the test walks the generated tree and refuses any plain twin -- it does not ask the
writer whether it wrote one.

*The bootstrap stays small.* Schema 2's is 5,702,530 bytes because 2,059 activity bins are inlined
into the file a browser must read first. The test pins that bins are absent from the bootstrap and
present in a shard, which is the decision, rather than pinning a byte count, which is the weather.

*A refusal leaves nothing behind.* Publication is all-or-nothing, because a shard written before a
later refusal is named by no manifest and so can never be reaped. The test provokes the latest
refusal there is -- one raised in the spine pass, after every timeline shard would have been
written -- and asserts the tree is empty.

*Seeking works.* `SeekableJsonlReader.data_bytes_read` is the instrument, as in
`test_seekable_jsonl.py`: a windowed read must touch less than the shard, and timing would prove
nothing on a fast machine.
