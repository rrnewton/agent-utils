"""Contract tests for the slicing read paths in :mod:`agent_team_timeline.query`.

The read path was rewritten to stop materializing the transcript projections, and a rewrite
whose entire point is "it costs less" needs its cost asserted rather than described. Three
instruments do that here, and none of them is a clock:

*``TranscriptQuery.bytes_read``.* A byte count is a proof; a timing assertion is a flake on a
loaded build host. Every laziness claim below is a bound on this counter, including the one
that matters most -- that constructing the object reads nothing at all.

*A full-scan reference.* Every seek, bisect and backwards read is checked against the obvious
implementation over the same records. The seek is only interesting if it returns the same
answer, so the answer is computed both ways and compared, over a sweep of window bounds that
deliberately lands on, one before, and one after instants shared by several records.

*A differential against the package reader.* ``_ChunkedJsonlReader`` is a standalone-library
copy of :class:`agent_team_timeline.seekable_jsonl.SeekableJsonlReader`, kept separate because
this file is copied verbatim into every generated archive as the ``./timeline`` executable and
may import nothing but the standard library. The duplication is pinned here rather than by a
comment, because a comment does not fail.
