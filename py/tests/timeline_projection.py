"""Read a built archive's timeline as the schema-1 object the tests were written against.

A published build no longer writes ``data/timeline.json``. Dozens of assertions across this
suite were nonetheless written against that object, and they are the right assertions: they say
things about *the projection* -- that a reused subagent gets exactly one structural join, that a
backfilled phase invalidates its dependents, that an out-of-window overview is suppressed --
which have nothing to do with which container the projection is stored in.

Rewriting each of them against schema 3's shards would have retyped a hundred assertions in the
vocabulary of a storage format, and would have made every one of them a test of the reader as
well as of the thing it was about. So the container moves and the assertions do not: this
module reconstructs the schema-1 collections from whatever generation the archive actually has.

That reconstruction is also the *claim schema 3 makes about itself*, executed. `timeline_v3`
states that removing ``record_kind``, and removing ``at_ms`` from every kind but ``event``,
recovers the schema-1 record byte for byte, and that no record is duplicated across shards. This
function is that sentence as code, so a change that quietly broke it would take most of the
suite with it rather than one test named after the property.

**What is deliberately not reproduced is order.** Schema 3 sorts a timeline shard by instant and
a spine group by the kind's identifier, and neither is schema 1's insertion order. Collections
come back sorted by a stable key, so an assertion that indexes positionally into one of them is
asserting something this file cannot promise -- and, since the on-disk order is now a property of
the writer's sort rather than of the renderer, was asserting something it should not have.
