"""IRQ-aware core selection: it still allocates, AND it changes placement.

A change that satisfies only one of those is invisible, so every behaviour here
is asserted from both sides -- the allocator keeps returning the right cores in
the right shape, and the interrupt signal demonstrably moves the selection,
verified by flipping which cores are hot and requiring the answer to follow.

The interrupt source is synthetic ``/proc`` text rather than the live host,
because the live signal is bursty (measured: an extreme core appears in the
top-32 of only 2 of 8 independent 0.3s samples) and a test keyed on it would be
flaky. Burstiness is a property of the machine; the ranking rule is what these
tests pin down. ``scripts/irq_survey.py`` measures the live host.
