"""A skipped differential check is its own result, never a pass.

``cross/differential.py`` cannot run every case everywhere: some need cgroup-v2 boxing, some must
not create a live systemd scope from inside a parent-owned delegated cgroup, some need a HARD
cpuset pin, and some need two usable CPUs or, for the CPA planner's memory cap, a core budget of
eight. Such a check used to be recorded with ``Report.ok``, so a run in which none of those checks
executed printed the same ``OK - N checks`` line and exit status as a run in which they all
passed.

These tests pin the replacement contract without running the minutes-long harness:

* a skip never increments the pass count and is listed by name with a total;
* a run that claims full coverage (no ``--allow-skip``) exits nonzero when anything was skipped;
* a run that declares itself partial prints PARTIAL, not OK, and still lists every skip;
* a boxed leg that cannot be boxed is a skip, and one whose engines never announced an
  established box is a failure, never agreement;
* the cpuset-alloc delegated, HARD-refusal and one-CPU branches list exactly the checks they did
  not run;
* the CPA planner's one-core and four-core budgets list the checks they could not run, and an
  eight-core budget runs them all;
* ``--tool all`` ends with one line that is PARTIAL or FAILED whenever any tool was;
* ``scripts/validate.py`` names a partial cross node in its summary, although dagrun shows that
  node as a plain PASS;
* each lane that runs the harness states its coverage policy explicitly.
