"""Run the archive's JavaScript suites from the Python gate that actually runs.

`tests/js/` holds six Node suites over `static/app.js` and `static/timeline-core.js`, and until
this file existed **one** of them ran anywhere: the GitHub workflow names
`tests/js/test_timeline_core.js` by hand, and `make validate` -- the gate this repository
requires before every push -- runs no JavaScript at all. The other five were written, committed,
and thereafter executed by nobody, which is the same state as not existing except that it looks
like coverage.

The suites are discovered by glob rather than listed, for the reason `scripts/validate.py` gives
about naming one page suite instead of the pattern: a list is how the next suite comes to exist
without ever running. Each file is a separate parametrised case so a failure names the suite
rather than "the JavaScript".

Node is not a dependency of this package -- the archive it builds is served as static files and
read by a browser -- so a host without it skips rather than fails. That is a real weakness and
it is stated rather than hidden: on a host with no Node these tests prove nothing, and CI is
where they are load-bearing.
