"""Contract tests for reading a built archive through schema 3.

Three claims carry this change, and each is asserted on evidence rather than on the reader's
own description of itself.

*The answers do not change.* Schema 3 is a cheaper way to reach the same records, so the whole
file is built around a differential: one fixture is published as schema 1, schema 2 and schema
3 at once, three archives are opened over the same tree with the newer bootstraps progressively
hidden, and every list, show, search and stats surface is required to return byte-identical
JSON from all three. A read path that is fast and different is not a read path, it is a second
archive.

*The seek is real, measured in bytes.* ``TimelineQuery.bytes_read`` is the instrument, as in
`test_query_read_paths.py`, and ``TimelineQuery.opened_shards`` is the second one: a byte count
can be small for the wrong reason, but a shard that was never opened was never read. The
strongest assertion here is not a ratio, it is that a one-team listing opens exactly one file
and that no surface ever opens the timeline stream, which is 93% of the generation.

*A partial publication is refused, not misread.* Every clause of the completeness rule gets a
test that damages the tree in exactly that way and requires the reader to say so and fall back
-- because a schema-3 generation that is read as complete when it is not returns a listing with
a team silently missing from it, which is indistinguishable from a team that did no work.

Named `test_timeline_*` rather than `test_query_*` because the packaged workflow runs
`pytest tests/test_timeline_*.py` and a file outside that glob runs only under `make validate`.
