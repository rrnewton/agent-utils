"""An absent number is not a zero, in two places where the scheduler used to say it was.

A missing value defaulted to 0 reads, downstream, exactly like a real measured 0 — and in both
places below the default silently turned off the very thing it was standing in for.

*A resource cap.*  The readiness gate reads ``resource_avail.get(name, 0)``, which collapses two
conditions whose remedies are opposites: the author FORGOT to declare capacity for a resource a
step demands, versus the author DELIBERATELY capped it at 0 to block the step.  Both produced
byte-identical behaviour — the step never becomes ready, the ready-set loop keeps sleeping, and
the run sits at 0% CPU printing nothing until some outer deadline kills it.

*A CPU counter.*  The CPU-time guard read ``cpu.stat``'s ``usage_usec`` with a default of 0.  A
cgroup that does not publish that counter therefore reported "this step has burned no CPU"
forever, which made the budget comparison permanently unsatisfiable: a declared ``cpu_timeout``
enforced nothing, quietly, with no warning anywhere.

These tests bracket both distinctions BOTH ways.  A one-sided test would pass if the code simply
flagged every resource demand or refused every CPU budget, so the legitimate cases are asserted
just as hard as the broken ones.
