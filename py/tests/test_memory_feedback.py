"""The profile-to-admission path must never learn a smaller cap from a censored sample.

A peak recorded while a ``memory.max`` was clamping proves only that the step used all it was
allowed. Deriving a cap from it re-derives the cap that produced it, so the workload is pinned
at whatever ceiling it was first given. These tests pin the three ways that is prevented: a
censored sample is a floor and never a central estimate, an unprovenanced sample is not
evidence at all, and with no uncensored evidence the authored hint survives untouched.
