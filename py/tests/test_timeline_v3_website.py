"""The browser bundle reads schema 3, over HTTP, from the server the archive ships.

Every other test of the website reads `static/app.js` as text, or drives a few functions out of it
in a Node realm with a hand-built stub for whatever they touch. That is the right shape for
matching a regular expression or checking an excerpt, and it is the wrong shape for the question
this file asks, which is whether the bundle can actually *read an archive* -- because every part
that could be wrong lives in the seam between three components a stub replaces:

* the writer, :func:`agent_team_timeline.timeline_v3.write_timeline_v3`, which decides where a
  member ends and what its sidecar says about it;
* the server, :mod:`agent_team_timeline.standalone_server`, which is copied verbatim into the
  archive as ``serve.py`` and answers one byte range with a 206, honours ``If-Range``, and answers
  416 past the end; and
* the reader in ``app.js``, which turns a catalogue entry into a byte range and a byte range back
  into records.

So this test uses all three, unstubbed: the shards are written by the writer, served by the server
on loopback, and read by functions sliced out of the bundle. `tests/js/test_timeline_v3_ui.js` is
the companion and owns the opposite half -- the refusals, which need a server that misbehaves on
demand and therefore cannot be the real one.

Node is not a dependency of this package, so a host without it skips, exactly as
`test_timeline_js_suites.py` does and with the same admission: on such a host these tests prove
nothing, and CI is where they are load-bearing.
