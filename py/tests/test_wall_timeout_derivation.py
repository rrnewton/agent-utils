"""A wall backstop should be derived from the CPU budget, not baked into the graph.

`Step.timeout` used to default to a hardcoded 1800 the moment a document was loaded, which is
exactly the load-sensitive number a derivation exists to remove: it is the same on a laptop and
on a 300-core host, and it tells you nothing about the step. parallel-experiment-runner already
solved this — explicit wall wins, else 3x the CPU budget, else the default — and this brings the
same idiom here rather than inventing a second policy.

Two design questions had to be ANSWERED, not merely implemented, and both are pinned below:

* derive from the DECLARED cpu_timeout, never the canonical (default-filled) one, or every
  undeclared step would silently drop from a 1800-second ceiling to a 30-second one; and
* derive from the PLATFORM-SCALED budget, or the backstop would race the CPU guard on exactly
  the slow platform `cpu_timeout_multiplier` exists for.

A third answer was added after review: the derivation is FLOORED at the default, so it can only
ever move a step's ceiling away from its CPU guard. Unfloored it retimed every already-authored
step that declared a CPU budget, and for anything that blocks — a fetch, a lock wait — wall time
is unbounded relative to CPU time, so three times a small budget is not a hang.
