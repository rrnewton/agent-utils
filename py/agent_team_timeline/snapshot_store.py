"""Where the vendor source snapshots live, and how an existing archive moves them there.

Every number below was measured on 2026-08-24 against one archive, read-only.

The snapshots are the largest thing the tool produces and the only thing it produces that is not
output. On the measured archive they are **995 files and 6,524,876,923 bytes of a 9,662,206,589-byte
archive -- 67.5%** -- and until this module existed all of it sat at
``<output>/teams/<slug>/source_snapshots/``: inside the directory the operator publishes, inside
the directory ``serve``/``serve.py`` roots an HTTP server at, and inside the directory a consumer
clones. The tool already said it did not consider them part of the artifact -- ``pipeline``'s
generated ``.gitignore`` has excluded ``/teams/*/source_snapshots/`` since the tree existed -- so
the intent was settled and only the physical placement was left. This module moves it.

They cannot simply be deleted, which is why this is a relocation. Three separate things still read
them:

* **The append-only guards.** Codex and Claude compare the live rollout against the bytes already
  copied, and Orc's ``_prepare_snapshot_candidate`` opens the *previous* content-addressed SQLite
  object, verifies it against the digest in ``raw/source-manifest.json``, and recomputes logical
  state from it. Take the tree away and the next incremental ingest either refuses or silently
  loses its baseline.
* **The frozen task-note projections** under ``.projections/``. See "What is uniquely here" below;
  on the measured archive these are still the only copy of 38,094 notes.
* **The losslessness audit**, whose whole job is to account for every vendor row against the
  archive, and which is the gate any future *deletion* has to pass.

Where the default goes
----------------------

``<output>.sources/`` -- a sibling of the published directory, named after it, holding one
directory per team slug::

    /path/to/summary/widget            <- --output, published, served, cloned
    /path/to/summary/widget.sources/   <- the snapshot store
    /path/to/summary/widget.sources/<team-slug>/...

A sibling rather than a state directory under ``$XDG_STATE_HOME`` or ``~/.cache``, and the reason
is the migration rather than taste. A sibling is on the same filesystem as the archive in every
layout anyone actually has, so moving an existing tree there is ``os.replace`` per team: atomic,
instant, and impossible to half-finish inside one team. A state directory is on the same
filesystem only by luck, and for the measured archive the unlucky case is a 6.5 GB copy that can
be interrupted -- turning "relocate" into "duplicate, verify, then delete", which is a materially
more dangerous operation to hand an operator by default. The sibling also keeps the pairing legible
(``widget`` and ``widget.sources`` sort next to each other) and survives the operator moving the
enclosing directory, which a path recorded under ``$HOME`` does not.

It is *outside* ``--output``, which is the point, and that has one consequence worth stating
plainly: a command given ``--output X`` writes to a directory that is not under ``X``. That is
unusual enough to be worth announcing, so the first ingest that establishes a store says so on
stderr, and the location is recorded in the archive rather than merely derived, so it can be read
back rather than guessed.

The store ignores itself. ``<store>/.gitignore`` contains ``/*``, which ignores every entry
including the ``.gitignore`` -- so a store that lands inside somebody's repository is invisible to
``git status`` rather than being proposed as a 6.5 GB addition. The archive's own ``.gitignore``
cannot do that job any more, because the store is no longer inside the archive, and writing a
``.gitignore`` into the *parent* of ``--output`` would be the tool editing a directory it was never
given.

How a run finds the store
-------------------------

Resolution is deliberately boring, and every branch of it is a refusal or a documented default:

1. ``--snapshot-root`` on the command line, or ``snapshot_root`` in a project config.
2. otherwise ``<output>/snapshot-root.json``, written by the run that established the layout.
3. otherwise, if ``teams/<slug>/source_snapshots/`` is populated, *that* -- an archive built by an
   older tool keeps working, untouched, with no flag and no migration.
4. otherwise ``<output>.sources/``.

Nothing here ever moves a file. An archive in the old layout stays in the old layout until an
operator runs ``migrate-snapshots``, because a build that silently relocated 6.5 GB as a side
effect of being run for some other reason is precisely the behaviour a "safe and explicit
migration" requirement exists to forbid. The disagreements that could quietly split an archive's
snapshots across two trees, or point a run at the wrong one, are refusals instead:

* a requested root while **any** team in the archive still keeps its snapshots inside it. Asked of
  the archive rather than of the team being ingested, because "one archive, one layout" is a
  property of the archive: a new team given ``--snapshot-root`` beside eleven un-migrated ones
  used to succeed, record ``external`` in the archive-wide pointer, and leave the other eleven
  refusing on the next run.
* a pointer that says the store is external while *this team's* in-archive directory is still
  populated -- an interrupted migration, which reads as "finish it" rather than "start again", and
  which is asked per team on purpose so that the teams already moved keep ingesting while the rest
  wait.
* a recorded store that is not on disk, when snapshots have been copied for this archive before.
  See :func:`_recorded_store`; the one case that is *not* a refusal there is the archive and its
  store having been renamed together, which the sibling's own marker identifies.

What is uniquely here
---------------------

Checked against the measured archive rather than assumed, because the answer decided whether a
move is enough or a copy is required:

* ``.projections/<prefix>/<sha>.json`` -- the frozen task-note history. Its schema-2 records carry
  exactly ``note_id``, ``task_id``, ``content``, ``created_at``, ``server_author``, ``task_owner``
  and ``title``; :class:`agent_team_timeline.model.TaskNote` carries all seven plus provenance, so
  the promotion into tracked ``raw/task-notes.jsonl`` is field-complete. **It has not run on the
  measured archive**: no Orc team there has a ``raw/task-notes.jsonl`` at all, so today those four
  projection files -- 70,572,760 bytes, 38,094 notes, 1,386 of them with no upstream row left --
  are still the only copy. Field-complete code that has not been executed protects nothing, which
  is the whole reason this is a move.
* ``.objects/<prefix>/<sha>.db`` and, in the pre-content-addressed layout, ``.orc/`` and ``.tg/``
  -- the previous-snapshot baseline the Orc append guard reads.
* the vendor Codex/Claude JSONL -- still the only copy of command stdout and patch bodies for any
  team ingested before ``teams/<slug>/payloads/`` existed. On the measured archive that is *every*
  team: it contains 0 payload files.

Every reference into the tree is relative to the snapshot root -- ``OrcSourceCopy.snapshot_path``,
``OrcTaskProjection.path``, ``CodexSourceCopy.source_path`` -- so relocating the root leaves all of
them valid. That is not luck; it is the property that makes a rename a complete migration.

    ``KeyboardInterrupt``, or the ENOSPC that is the likeliest reason a cross-filesystem move was
    needed in the first place -- left a half tree at the target. From there the two commands

    the pointer declares the store authoritative and the copy looks done -- destroys the only
    copy of the vendor logs and the frozen note projections.

    With staging there is no such state. The target is created by an ``os.replace`` of a fully
    verified tree, which is same-device and atomic because the staging directory lives inside the
    store; the source is removed only after that. Anything left behind on failure is a directory
    under ``.staging/``, which is unambiguously this command's own scratch -- ``.staging`` cannot
    be a team slug, the grammar has no leading dot -- so the next run deletes it and starts that
