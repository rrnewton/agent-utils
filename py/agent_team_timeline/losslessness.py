"""The losslessness gate: prove, row by row, what the archive would lose if the vendor logs went.

``teams/*/source_snapshots/`` is 5.83 GB of the 8.79 GB archive, 3.59 GB of it vendor Codex JSONL,
and it is gitignored -- one ``rm -rf`` from gone. The reason nobody can run that command is not
that the vendor format is preferred; it is that nobody can currently *state* what it still holds
that the normalized model does not. This module is the thing that states it.

**It is a differential, not an assertion.** It does not ask the reader whether it dropped
something. It re-enumerates the vendor rows independently, one file at a time, and requires every
single one to fall under a rule that says in words what became of it, then checks the rule's claim
against the archive. Three outcomes matter and they are deliberately different:

* **unaccounted** -- no rule matched. This is the failure the module exists for. A new Codex record
  type, a renamed payload type, a vendor field that starts carrying content it did not carry
  before: all of them land here, on the first audit after they appear, instead of being silently
  absent from every archive built afterwards. There is no default rule and no catch-all, because a
  catch-all is precisely how the drop this module was written to find became invisible in the
  first place.
* **unverified** -- a rule matched and its claim was false. The row says an event exists at this
  line and there is none; a tool call says its stdout is in the payload store and the digest does
  not resolve, or resolves to different bytes. A rule table that is never checked is documentation,
  and documentation drifts.
* **declared lossy** -- a rule matched and its claim is that the content is *not* retained. That is
  not a failure; it is the inventory. The bytes under these rules are exactly the bytes that still
  make ``source_snapshots/`` load-bearing, and their total is the number to watch go to zero.

**Why it is not shaped like a two-implementation differential.** The usual form of that test runs
two builds of one program and byte-compares their observable output. There is no second
implementation here, and the two things being compared are not two programs but a corpus and a
projection of it. What this borrows from that form is the part that makes it worth having: an
explicit enumeration of what is claimed, a refusal to compare only the easy fields, and a nonzero
exit on any divergence. Within this package the closest existing shape is
:mod:`agent_team_timeline.glossary_audit` -- a read-only pass over archive state, no lock, no model
call, a typed report and a CLI subcommand -- and this follows that.

**Coverage is Codex only, and that is a choice, not an oversight.** Codex is where the 3.59 GB is,
it is the provider the retired ``_archive_team`` docstring named as "the authority for command
stdout and patch bodies", and its rollout JSONL is a flat row-per-line corpus that can be
enumerated independently of the reader. Claude's transcripts and Orc's SQLite would each need
their own enumeration and their own rule table; a half-written rule table for three providers would
report "everything is accounted for" for the two whose rows it never learned to see, which is worse
than reporting nothing. :func:`audit_archive_losslessness` names the uncovered teams explicitly in
its report rather than omitting them.

**What running it costs.** It reads the whole vendor corpus, one file at a time, and holds one
file's parsed records at once -- the same shape the reader itself uses, for the same reason: the
canonical-record boundary for a subagent session cannot be found without the records before it.
This is an audit invoked deliberately before an irreversible deletion, not something on the ingest
path.
