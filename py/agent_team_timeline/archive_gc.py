"""Reclaim what a built archive no longer produces, reversibly and under the writer's lock.

An archive is append-heavy by construction. Every build publishes a new generation of the
presentation timeline beside the last, every format generation that was ever written stays
written until something removes it, and the two mechanisms that already remove things --
`render._remove_stale_presentation_files` and `timeline_shards._finish_object_generation` --
only ever reap what the *current* build's own manifest stopped naming. Neither can see a whole
format generation that a newer tool stopped emitting, because a file nobody writes is a file no
manifest lists, and "absent from the manifest" is exactly the signal those two use to mean
"delete". A retired generation therefore falls into the one gap between them: too dead to be
rewritten, too unnamed to be reaped.

This module is that gap, made explicit. It is a **third** user of the same mark-and-sweep idiom
rather than a second idiom:

* :func:`timeline_shards._finish_object_generation` marks with `current_objects`, sweeps
  `previous - current - retained`, and holds a `retained_objects` set: the objects the *previous*
  generation named and this one no longer does, kept alive one more generation so that a browser
  which already loaded the previous bootstrap can still fetch what it points at. That grace is
  gated by `_scope_allows_retention`, which grants it only when the new build covered the same
  teams and a window no narrower -- that is, only when the new generation genuinely supersedes
  the old one. A narrowed re-export gets no grace and takes the older objects with it, which is
  consistent rather than surprising: the archive it leaves behind describes exactly what was
  re-exported. The precedent to carry across is the shape, not the scope rule: **something is
  released only once a named successor has demonstrably taken over its job, and never merely
  because the last build did not mention it.**
* :func:`render.prune_retired_query_artifacts` removes one specific retired output -- the
  generated `query.py` launcher -- and only when it can prove the file is the one the tool
  wrote, either because a manifest claimed it or because its bytes still match the bundled
  source.

`gc` generalises both across *format generations*, and inherits both of their refusals. Nothing
is reclaimed on the strength of "the current build did not write it". Something is reclaimed only
when a **named superseding artefact is present and complete**, checked by the reader's own
acceptance rule, or when a manifest that is authoritative over a directory says the file is in
neither its current nor its retained set.

Retiring a whole generation needs one thing more
------------------------------------------------
A superseding artefact says the archive can still be read without the old generation. It does not
say the old generation has *stopped being produced*, and for a format that is still written those
are different: reclaiming this build's own output is churn, and the operator who runs `gc` after
every build would pay for it every time. The schema-1 monolith did not have to ask, because it
was already unwritten when it was given a category. Schema 2 does, because it is 1.4 GB and it is
still the website's only format.

The answer cannot come from the archive. Objects are content addressed and the bootstrap goes
through `write_text_if_changed`, so a build that republishes an identical schema 2 moves no mtime
at all -- on a measured archive the newest schema-2 object was thirteen hours *older* than the
schema-3 bootstrap while that same build's `data/export.json` named all 661 schema-2 files as its
own output. So the answer comes from the code: `timeline_shards.SCHEMA_2_IS_PUBLISHED`, which
`timeline_shards.write_timeline_shards` enforces by refusing to run while it is false. "No build
did" is an observation and this module refuses to act on one; "no build can" is a property, and
that is what a category worth 1.4 GB is gated on. See :func:`_schema_2_retirement_refusal`.

…and one thing that had no successor until it did
-------------------------------------------------
"Schema 3 replaces schema 2" used to be true of the *presentation timeline* and false of the
archive: the transcript search corpus was a set of schema-2 content-addressed day shards with
trigram blooms, catalogued in the ``search`` section of ``data/timeline-v2.json``, and a search
under schema 3 read phases and agents from the spine and *messages from schema 2*. That is 500.5
MiB of the 1,434.2 MiB this module sees in the generation on the measured archive -- 35% -- and it
was not a duplicate copy of anything, so reclaiming it would not have made the archive slower, it
would have deleted `timeline search` and `timeline show` outright.

Schema 3 now publishes a corpus of its own: the ``search``, ``search_bloom`` and ``search_links``
streams of `timeline_v3`, read by ``query.TimelineQuery._iter_search_records``, which opens
``data/timeline-v2.json`` only for an archive built before they existed. So the corpus finally has
the thing every other category here requires -- a *named, present* successor -- and
:func:`_schema_2_search_corpus_category` asks the archive whether it has one instead of holding
unconditionally.

The two facts stay separate, which is the part worth keeping. Retiring the *format* and superseding
the *corpus* are still different events with different evidence: the format is retired by a
constant in the writer (:data:`timeline_shards.SCHEMA_2_IS_PUBLISHED`) and the corpus is superseded
by shards this archive can be seen to hold. An archive can be in either state without the other --
the common one today is a schema 3 that carries the corpus while the format is still published for
the website -- and in that state the corpus bytes join the whole-generation category and are held
there with the format's own reason, rather than being held twice under two.

Two more questions the retirement has to ask
--------------------------------------------
`query.schema_3_completeness` is the reader's acceptance rule and it is entirely
*intra-generation*: all five clauses compare the schema-3 bootstrap against itself and against
its own tree. It cannot see that the generation beside it is **newer**, and one exists --
`render.render_archive` publishes schema 2 and then schema 3, so a build killed in between leaves
a new schema 2 next to an untouched old schema 3, self-consistent and a team short. Reclaiming
on completeness alone would then take the newer generation and keep the older one, which is the
one outcome worse than reclaiming nothing. The reader already treats that mismatch as a refusal
where it can see it -- ``_search_bootstrap`` compares ``source_digest`` across the two bootstraps
and declines rather than papering over it -- so :func:`_cross_generation_refusal` makes the same
comparison *before* the sweep, because the reader only makes it when somebody searches and by
then the bytes are gone. See :func:`_cross_generation_refusal` for why this is asked of schema 2
and not of the monolith.

The other question is the browser. `gc` reclaims without rebuilding -- that is the point of it --
but the archive carries its **own copy** of ``app.js``, written by the build that made it, and
`gc` does not rewrite it. A copy from before the flip has no schema-3 mode at all: it loads
``data/timeline-v2.json`` as its timeline and falls back to ``data/timeline.json``, and this pass
offers both. So the graphical surface would go silently, at the moment the operator was told they
were reclaiming a superseded copy. :func:`_website_refusal` asks the positive question instead --
does this archive's own ``app.js`` name the schema-3 bootstrap -- and holds the generation until a
build has put one there. That is the same shape as every other precondition here: a named
successor has to be *present*, not merely conceivable.

The rejected design: sweeping everything ``data/export.json`` does not name
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The export manifest is a complete positive inventory of one build's presentation output, so
"delete everything under the archive that is not in it" looks like the whole feature in one
line. It is refused, for two reasons that are different failures.

The first is scope. The manifest covers the *presentation* tree and nothing else, while the
archive it lives in also holds `teams/`, `runs/`, `extracted/`, `qa/`, the marker, the lock, and
whatever an operator put there -- none of which any manifest names and all of which that rule
would propose deleting. The negation of a partial inventory is not a garbage set.

The second is that it is the very inference this module exists to *avoid*. "The last build did
not write it" is what `_remove_stale_presentation_files` already acts on, correctly, within the
one directory its manifest is authoritative over -- and it is precisely why the schema-1 monolith
had to be given a `retired_files` seat rather than being left to that sweep. Rebuilding the same
inference at archive scope, where nothing is authoritative, would generalise the hazard instead
of the mechanism. So `gc` reasons only forwards: a file goes when something *else*, named and
verified, has taken over its job.

Why the first pass moves rather than unlinks
--------------------------------------------
The measured archive costs hours of model time to rebuild and holds 9.1 GB across roughly forty
thousand files; the single largest thing `gc` can reclaim is a 246,973,399-byte JSON document.
A wrong `unlink` there is not a slow afternoon, it is a re-ingest. So the first destructive
operation is `os.replace` into ``.agent-team-timeline-trash/<generation>/files/<original path>``,
which preserves the archive-relative path exactly, so undoing a sweep is copying one directory
tree back over the archive. The generation directory carries a ``receipt.json`` naming every
file, its category, its size and the reason it was judged dead -- written *before* the first move
as a statement of intent and rewritten after the last one as a record, so that a sweep which dies
partway still leaves the operator a list rather than a traceback. See :func:`_receipt`.

Emptying the trash is a **separate invocation with a separate flag**. That is the whole design:
`--delete` is reversible and `--empty-trash` is not, and no single command does both, because a
command that swept and emptied in one pass would have exactly the failure mode the trash exists
to prevent.

What `gc` will not touch, and why
---------------------------------
* **`teams/*/source_snapshots/`** -- 6,524,876,923 bytes across 995 files on the measured
  archive, 72% of it, and genuinely not output: it is the vendor material ingest reads. It is
  already gitignored and already excluded from every manifest. `gc` reports it, at its full size,
  because an operator asking "what is in my output that is not output" deserves that number as
  the first line of the answer -- and then declines to reclaim it, because the archive has a
  purpose-built gate for exactly that deletion (`audit-losslessness --require-lossless`, whose
  own help says "run this before deleting source snapshots"). A second, weaker gate beside a
  strong one is not a convenience.
* **`retained_objects`** -- the schema-2 objects the last build deliberately kept alive for one
  more generation, so that a reader holding the previous bootstrap can still fetch what it
  names. Reclaiming them would collapse that grace period to zero at exactly the moment it is
  being used, since the operator most likely to run `gc` is the one who has just rebuilt and is
  looking at what the rebuild left behind -- which is when a browser tab from before the rebuild
  is still open. The next build supersedes them and they go on their own. That reasoning holds
  only while something still *writes* schema 2; when the format itself is retired the grace
  period has nobody left to protect, and the whole generation moves into one category. See
  :func:`_schema_2_categories`.
* **The transcript search corpus, when this archive's schema 3 does not carry one.** The
  schema-2 bootstrap and the day shards and linkage sidecars its ``search`` section names -- 500.5
  MiB and 144 objects on the measured archive. Held at full size while it is the only copy, and
  held *even once the schema-2 presentation format is retired*, because retiring a format does not
  by itself give a corpus a successor. An archive whose schema 3 publishes the ``search`` streams
  has one, and there these bytes stop being a capability and become a duplicate like everything
  else in the generation. See :func:`_schema_2_search_corpus_category`.
* **Schema-3 shards the bootstrap does not name.** Reported, never reclaimed. Absence from the
  catalogue does not say whether the shard is a retired team's or a live team's: the answer turns
  entirely on whether the bootstrap beside it is newer or older than the shard, which nothing on
  disk states. So the publisher settles it instead -- `timeline_v3.write_timeline_v3` clears its
  own root of everything outside its plan once its bootstrap is published -- and any leftover
  `gc` can see is therefore residue from a build that did not finish. The remedy is to run one,
  not to sweep. See :func:`_schema_3_category`.
* **Anything at all, when the artefact that would supersede it is absent or incomplete.** The
  measured archive today has no schema-3 generation, so a `gc` run against it reclaims nothing
  from the schema-1 monolith and says so in a sentence. That is the intended behaviour on a
  first run and the reason the report distinguishes "reclaimable" from "held (<reason>)" instead
  of printing one total.

Concurrency
-----------
Both the dry run and the sweep take :func:`pipeline.archive_writer_lock`. The dry run takes it
too -- despite reading nothing -- because its output is the input to a human's decision, and a
listing computed beside a running build names files the build is halfway through replacing.

A reader mid-flight is a different question, and the answer is POSIX rather than a lock: readers
of a built archive take no lock (that is the point of the format), so `gc` can move a file out
from under one. A reader that already has the file open keeps reading it, because the rename
does not disturb the open description; a reader that has not opened it yet gets `ENOENT` on a
file it learned about from a manifest that `gc` has, by construction, already established does
not name it. The residual case -- a reader that read a stale manifest before the sweep and opens
the path after it -- degrades to a missing file rather than a wrong answer, and unlike the
existing stale-file removal it is recoverable from the trash.

    all five of its clauses are about one generation's internal agreement -- the bootstrap parses,
    the codec is one this reader implements, the spine covers the declared teams, every named
    shard is present at its declared length, and nothing on disk is unnamed. A generation can
    satisfy every one of those and still be **older than the generation it is being used to
    retire**, and one specific accident produces exactly that: `render.render_archive` writes
    schema 2 and then schema 3, in that order, with no atomicity across the pair, so a build that
    dies in between -- OOM, ENOSPC, a validation error inside `write_timeline_v3` -- leaves a new
    schema 2 next to the previous build's schema 3, untouched and perfectly self-consistent. The
    writer's lock is released by process death, so nothing stops `gc` running next.

    Reclaiming there would take the newer generation and keep the older one. On a three-team
    export whose schema 3 is a build behind, that is a team whose presentation data exists in no
    readable generation at all -- and the pass would say ``superseded``, because from inside
    schema 3 everything is in order.

    ``source_digest`` settles it, and this is not a new rule invented for a collector: it is the
    reader's, from ``query.TimelineQuery._search_bootstrap``, which refuses outright when the two
    generations disagree because "the phases would come from one build and the messages from
    another". The reader makes that comparison lazily -- only when something searches -- which is
    correct for a reader and useless here, because by the time anybody searches `gc` has already
    moved the bytes. So the same comparison is made eagerly, once, before the sweep.

    **Asked of schema 2 and not of the schema-1 monolith**, deliberately. The monolith is not
    written by a published build at all, so it cannot be the newest generation in an archive; the

    A subtle asymmetry, and the one thing about `gc` that a tool release cannot fix on its own.
    Every other precondition here is about the *tool*: flip a constant, ship a reader, and every
    archive in the world is ready at once. The website is not shipped, it is **copied** -- a build
    writes ``app.js`` into the archive it builds, and that copy then stays exactly as it was until
    another build overwrites it. `gc` does not rewrite it and should not: rewriting published
    assets is a build's job, and a collector that started editing JavaScript would be doing
    something nobody could audit from a receipt.

    So an archive built before the flip carries a bundle with no schema-3 mode -- it loads
    ``data/timeline-v2.json`` and falls back to ``data/timeline.json`` -- and this pass offers
    both of those. Sweeping without rebuilding, which is the whole convenience `gc` sells, would
    leave the operator an ``index.html`` that fails its first fetch, falls through to a file that
    is also in the trash, and shows an error. Silently, hours later, in somebody else's session.

    The test is the *positive* one: does this archive's ``app.js`` name the schema-3 bootstrap.
    Asking the negative -- "does it still mention ``data/timeline-v2.json``" -- would be wrong
    rather than merely fragile, because a post-flip bundle still fetches that file: it is the
    transcript search catalogue, which the flip does not retire. Presence of the schema-3 URL is
    the thing that actually distinguishes a bundle that can read this archive without schema 2's
    presentation objects from one that cannot.

    An archive with no ``app.js`` gets no refusal. There is no graphical surface there to protect,

    the same way -- by `query.schema_3_completeness`, the reader's own five-clause acceptance
    rule, called rather than restated so that `gc` can never say yes where the reader says no.
    **Will anything write this generation again**, which the monolith never had to ask, because
    when the monolith was retired the tool had already stopped emitting it and schema 2 was there
    to catch both readers. **Is that schema 3 a successor to this schema 2 or a bystander from
    another build**, which completeness structurally cannot see -- :func:`_cross_generation_refusal`.
    And **does the browser in this archive know about schema 3** -- :func:`_website_refusal`,
    the one precondition a tool release cannot satisfy on an operator's behalf.

    They are checked in that order because that is the order in which they stop being worth
    printing: an operator whose tool still writes schema 2 does not need to hear about their
    ``app.js``, and one whose schema 3 is a shard short does not need to hear about digests.

    The second question is answered from the *code* -- :data:`timeline_shards.SCHEMA_2_IS_PUBLISHED`
    via :func:`timeline_shards.schema_2_is_published` -- and never from the archive, because every
    archive-side signal for it is either wrong or circular:

    * **Modification times lie, and this tool is why.** Schema-2 objects are content addressed and
      the bootstrap goes through `write_text_if_changed`, so a build that republishes an identical
      schema 2 writes no byte and moves no mtime. A measured archive showed its newest schema-2
      object thirteen hours older than its schema-3 bootstrap while the most recent build's
      ``data/export.json`` named all 661 schema-2 files as its own ``generated_files`` and both
      bootstraps carried the same ``source_digest`` and ``generated_at``. An mtime rule would have
      released 1.4 GB that the next build would have written straight back -- and worse, it would
      have been the "the last build did not write it" inference this whole module refuses.
    * **The export manifest is the opposite mistake.** It does name the generation, exactly, and
      that is why it cannot be the gate: the manifest of an archive built before the retirement
      names schema 2 forever, so requiring its silence would hold the bytes until a rebuild that
      the operator is trying to avoid, and requiring its *presence* to hold would be the mtime
      rule with more steps. It is corroboration for a human -- the measured archive above -- not a
      precondition.

    So the writer declares it, once, in the place a future edit has to go through anyway, and
    :func:`timeline_shards.write_timeline_shards` refuses to run while the declaration says
    retired. That is the property mtimes cannot have: not "no build did", but "no build can".

    collection by :func:`_schema_1_category` under conditions that are satisfied whenever these

    Everything else `gc` offers is a *copy* of something a newer artefact also has: the monolith
    against schema 2, the schema-2 presentation objects against schema 3. For most of this
    module's life the transcript search corpus was not, and this category existed to say so: it
    had exactly one implementation -- content-addressed day shards with trigram blooms, catalogued
    in ``search`` in the schema-2 bootstrap -- and the reader reached into it from *under schema
    3*. Reclaiming it would not have slowed anything down, it would have deleted `timeline search`
    and `timeline show` from an archive whose schema 3 was in perfect order, and the pass would
    have said "superseded" while doing it.

    Schema 3 now publishes a corpus, so the condition this category always implied can finally be
    written down, and it is written as a question about **this archive** rather than about this
    tool: does the schema-3 bootstrap here name ``search`` shards. When it does, these bytes are a
    duplicate like every other byte in the generation, they stop being subtracted from
    ``superseded-schema-2``, and they are held or offered by whatever that category decides --
    which today still holds them, because the format is still published for the website. When it
    does not, the old reason stands unchanged and unconditionally.

    Deciding it per archive rather than by a constant in the writer is the whole point. The two
    facts are genuinely independent: a build can carry the schema-3 corpus while an archive on
    disk predates it, which is the state every existing archive is in until it is rebuilt once, and
    an archive in that state must keep its only copy no matter what version of the tool is asking.
    The rejected alternative -- gate on `timeline_v3` being *able* to write a corpus, the way the
    format's retirement gates on :data:`timeline_shards.SCHEMA_2_IS_PUBLISHED` -- is exactly the
    mistake :func:`_website_refusal` was written to avoid, and it would offer 500.5 MiB of the only
    copy an unrebuilt archive has.

    The other rejected alternative, from before there was a successor at all, was to gate the whole
    generation on the corpus and refuse all 1.4 GB until search was ported. It was rejected because
    two thirds of those bytes genuinely *were* superseded, and holding a superseded copy on account
    of an unrelated tenant of the same directory is the mirror image of the mistake this exists to
    prevent.

    """The whole schema-2 generation, split four ways that never overlap.

    ``(superseded, search, orphans, retained)``. The four are computed together, and *partition*
    the generation -- every schema-2 file appears in exactly one of them -- because they are the
    only categories in this module that describe the same bytes from two angles, and a file listed
    twice would be counted twice in ``held_bytes`` and, far worse, moved twice by a sweep: the
    second `os.replace` would fail on a file that is no longer there and abort the pass with a
    traceback. So the partition is structural rather than remembered. ``superseded`` is the
    generation *minus* whatever the other three claim.

    The search corpus is subtracted **in both worlds when it is subtracted at all**, and it is the
    only one of the three that is. Reachability and the grace period are properties of a live
    format and stop meaning anything once it is retired; being unsuperseded is not, and an archive
    whose schema 3 carries no ``search`` stream is in that state whether or not the format is
    retired. Taking it out of ``superseded`` while the generation is live changes no byte's fate --
    everything there is held regardless -- and it makes the report say the true thing early: of the
    1,434.2 MiB in this tree on the measured archive, 500.5 MiB was a capability with no successor
    and 933.7 MiB a copy of something schema 3 already had.

    Once an archive is rebuilt with the schema-3 search streams the subtraction stops, and it stops
    in both worlds too, for the symmetric reason: the corpus is then a duplicate, and a duplicate
    reported in a category whose name says "not superseded" would be the report lying in the
    direction that costs an operator disk rather than data.

    Which way the rest of the split falls depends on :func:`_schema_2_retirement_refusal`.

    **While the generation is live**, reachability is the only thing that can retire a file
    inside it, and the existing two categories do that job unchanged. The manifest's accounting
    is exact today -- on the measured archive 353 current plus 305 retained is 658, which is
    every one of the 334 ``.json`` and 324 ``.gz`` files on disk, with no orphan and nothing
    missing, and all 283 search objects are inside ``current_objects``, so the corpus never
    overlaps either of them -- and the orphan set is *derived* as ``on disk - current -
    retained``, so a non-empty one is a real finding about a crashed build rather than an artefact
    of `gc` counting differently. ``superseded`` then holds the remainder -- the manifest and the
    70 current objects that are not the corpus -- and holds it with the reason it cannot go. That
    remainder used to be reported by nobody: an operator asking where 1.4 GB went was shown 305
    retained objects and left to discover the rest themselves. A category that exists to explain a
    refusal has to name the bytes it is refusing.

    **Once it is retired**, the reachability split stops meaning anything and the presentation
    half moves into one category. ``retained`` in particular has no residual claim: its grace
    period exists so a browser holding the previous bootstrap can still fetch what that bootstrap
    names, and the precondition for retirement is that no browser reads this format at all. Both
    are reported as empty with a reason pointing at the category that took them, rather than
    dropped, because this module's rule is that a category keeps its reason even when it has no
    files.

    ``data/timeline-v3/`` and absent from the catalogue must have been reachable from a
    generation that no longer exists. **That reasoning is wrong, and the counterexample costs a
    team.** Publication is shards, then the bootstrap, with no atomicity across the set. A build
    that adds a team and dies after writing its shards and before writing the bootstrap leaves
    the *previous* bootstrap in place -- complete, self-consistent, naming files that are all
    present at their declared lengths -- with the new team's shards beside it, named by nobody.
    Absence from the catalogue therefore means "retired" if the bootstrap is newer than the
    shard and "live, and the newest thing here" if it is older, and nothing on disk says which.
    A rule that guessed would eventually sweep the better half of a rebuild, and would in the
    same pass declare the schema-1 monolith superseded and reclaim the archive's fallback.

    Two changes retire the question rather than answer it. The reader now checks the converse of
    its presence rule -- clause 5 of :class:`query._SchemaThreeArchive`, "nothing on disk is
    unnamed" -- so the interrupted generation above is declined rather than read as complete,
    which is what already keeps this category, and the monolith beside it, held. And the
    publisher clears its own root of everything outside its plan once its bootstrap is on disk,
    so a completed build always leaves the tree equal to its catalogue. Between them, a non-empty
    orphan set has exactly one meaning left: a build was interrupted. That is a finding to report
    and a build to re-run, not garbage to collect -- and `gc` is not the tool that should be
    deciding it, because it is the one tool here with no way to tell the two cases apart.

    So the files are still listed, at their full size, with the reason saying what they are.
