"""Schema 3: the presentation timeline as chunked, seekable JSONL.

Every number in this document was measured against one archive on one day, and that archive grows
daily. They are recorded to the byte anyway, because a rounded number cannot be re-derived and a
re-derivation that lands two per cent away is the only way to notice that a claim has gone stale.
Where a figure is quoted twice below it is the same measurement, taken on 2026-08-24.

Schema 1 is one JSON value of 246,973,399 bytes over 5,769,917 physical lines, and `inspect`
parses all of it at 1.44 GiB RSS to answer any question at all. Schema 2 broke that into 334
content-addressed objects, which fixed *addressability* and then gave most of the win back: the
objects are pretty-printed at two-space indent (~13 lines per record, 17% of the bytes buying
nothing a browser reads), every one of them large enough to be worth it is written twice -- once
plain and once as a `.gz` sidecar -- and the bootstrap that publishes them is 5,702,530 bytes
because 2,059 pre-aggregated activity bins are inlined into the file the browser must download
before it can draw anything.

Schema 3 keeps schema 2's shape -- a small stable bootstrap naming a set of immutable shards --
and changes what a shard *is*: a multi-member gzip file of minified JSONL, one record per line,
written through :mod:`agent_team_timeline.seekable_jsonl` and accompanied by that module's
sidecar index. The three consequences are the three defects above, each removed at its source:

* **Minified.** One line per record, `sort_keys`, no spaces. Re-encoding the schema-2 objects
  minified measured 83% of pretty; the indent was never read by anything.
* **Compressed only, with no plain twin.** Every `.gz` in the archive currently has an
  uncompressed sibling -- 2.42 GB of `.json` against 0.19 GB of `.gz` -- so compression there is
  duplication, not saving. A schema-3 shard exists once. It is still an entirely ordinary gzip
  file, so `zcat`, `gunzip`, `gzip -t`, `file(1)` and `gzip.open` all read it, and losing the
  sidecar costs speed and nothing else.
* **A bootstrap that fits in one packet's worth of parsing.** Activity bins are a shard, not an
  inline field; see "Where the activity bins went" below.

This module is the write path. What reads it is `query._SchemaThreeArchive`, which every list,
show, search and stats surface now goes through when a *complete* schema-3 generation is present
-- see that class for the completeness rule and for why a partial publication falls back rather
than being read.

**Neither older generation is written any more, and both are still read.** They were retired at
different times because their readers retired them at different times, and the second retirement
is recent enough to be worth stating plainly: schema 2 stayed long after `query.py` had moved on,
because `static/app.js` had no schema-3 mode and retiring the only format the graphical surface
could open would have retired the surface. It has one now. The bundle loads the bootstrap below
and pulls one gzip member of a shard at a time over HTTP Range, through the ``serve.py`` the
archive ships -- so the server seeks and the browser never meets a multi-member stream. See the
"Schema 3" block in ``static/app.js`` for that split and for the dynamic endpoint that was
refused, and `timeline_shards.SCHEMA_2_IS_PUBLISHED` for the checklist the flip had to satisfy.

Both readers still *open* the older generations, in the order schema 3, schema 2, schema 1, and
they have to: a build copies the bundle into the archive it builds, so an archive from last month
ships a bundle that has never heard of schema 3, and a reader from this month meets archives from
last month. `render.retired_generation_files` says why declining to write a generation and
deleting one had to be separate decisions, and reclaiming what an older build already wrote
belongs to :mod:`agent_team_timeline.archive_gc`, not to a build.

Schema 3 replaces the presentation *timeline* **and, since the search streams below, the
transcript search corpus too**. Until then a transcript search read phases and agents from a
schema-3 spine and messages from schema 2's content-addressed day shards -- the one operation
that touched both generations, and the one place the reader had to check that they described the
same source. Now that check has nothing left to compare: the messages come out of the same
bootstrap as the phases. See "The search streams" below for the whole design, and
`query.TimelineQuery._iter_search_records` for the reader that no longer opens
``data/timeline-v2.json`` when these streams are present. The website reads the same three
streams, which is what let the schema-2 generation stop being written at all.

The one thing schema 3 publishes that schema 1 does not is the zoom bounds; see
:data:`_ACTIVITY_BOUNDS_KIND` for why they are published rather than recomputed on read, and what
the 324,624 bytes buy.

Sharding axis: (team, UTC day)
------------------------------
The timeline stream is one shard per team per UTC day::

    data/timeline-v3/timeline/<team>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.jsonl.gz

*Not per agent.* There are 2,555 agents in the measured archive against 12 teams and 33 days, and
the dominant query is "the most recent N", which per-agent sharding turns into O(agents) file
opens. Day sharding answers it with one open per team. The compression locality that per-agent
files would have bought -- every line repeating the same `agent_id`, `agent_path` and `team` --
is recovered instead by sorting within the shard, which is the next paragraph.

*Not one file per team, either*, even though :mod:`seekable_jsonl` would make that read just as
cheaply: the sidecar index carries `t0`/`t1` per member, so a day range inside a whole-team file
is a bisect and two member reads, and the file count would drop from 72 to 12. The reason to cut
at the day is **write amplification**, the same reason :mod:`agent_team_timeline.payloads` shards
by digest prefix rather than keeping one `payloads.jsonl`: a rebuild that observes one new day
would otherwise recompress and republish every team's entire history, and `_replace_if_changed`
would correctly report all 12 files as changed. With day shards, yesterday is byte-identical and
the rebuild touches only today.

Measured, by building the archive with its final UTC day removed and then adding that day back:
**387,547 bytes rewritten across 7 files**, of a 38,288,394-byte schema-3 generation -- 1.01%.
The seven are that team's shard for that day, that team's spine, the bins shard, their three
sidecars, and the bootstrap. The same day landing in a one-file-per-team layout would have
rewritten 5,335,449 bytes, 13.8 times as much, and in the schema-1 monolith it rewrites all
280,971,189 (`data/timeline.json` and its `.gz` twin). Read cost is a wash between per-day and
per-team files; incremental cost is not.

The axis is also not new. The schema-2 search corpus already shards by `(team, UTC day)`, so this
reuses a partition the archive has already committed to rather than inventing a second one that
would have to be kept consistent with it.

**UTC, never the display timezone.** The archive's display timezone is a configured value
(`America/New_York` today, `display_timezone_source` records where it came from). Cutting shards
on local midnight would make the on-disk layout a function of that setting, so changing it would
rewrite every shard and invalidate every digest. Schema 2 already uses UTC days for the same
reason; the browser converts for display.

Sorted by `(at_ms, record_kind, line)` within a shard
-----------------------------------------------------
Total, deterministic, and the tiebreaker is the encoded line itself, so the order is defined by
exactly the bytes that land on disk and cannot depend on a field one record kind happens to lack.
Sorting by instant is what recovers per-agent compression locality without per-agent files --
records from one agent cluster in time -- and it is what makes `timestamps_sorted` true in the
sidecar, which is the precondition :func:`seekable_jsonl._bisectable` requires before the reader
may binary-search the member table.

Repeated fields are NOT factored out
------------------------------------
No struct-of-arrays, no per-shard string dictionary, no per-agent symbol table. Minified plus
gzip already reaches 6.3% on the two largest schema-2 objects, because gzip's LZ77
back-references *are* a dictionary coder for the repeated `agent_id`, `agent_path` and `team`
strings, and they cost nothing to decode and nothing to explain. Hand-factoring would buy a
fraction of an already-solved problem in exchange for a format `jq` cannot read -- and `jq` over
`zcat` is the fallback that makes this archive durable rather than merely compact.

**Delta-encoding `at_ms` was measured and rejected**, which is a stronger statement than
declining to try it. On the largest team's full timeline stream, replacing the absolute instant
with a delta from the day's start made the compressed output 2.07% *larger* (18,278,941 bytes to
18,657,655), and on a small team 10.4% larger: absolute 13-digit epoch milliseconds share a long
literal prefix that LZ77 back-references for free, while deltas are variable-width integers with
no such prefix. Isolated to the events stream alone -- where the instant is a tenth of the record
rather than a rounding error beside a prompt body -- delta-from-previous-record did win, 634,973
compressed bytes down to 485,145. It is still refused, for a reason size cannot outvote: the
sidecar index derives each member's `t0`/`t1` by reading `timestamp_key` off the records, so a
delta-encoded sort key leaves the index describing offsets instead of instants and destroys
`read_range`, `tail` and the bisect -- the entire property schema 3 exists to provide. Saving
150 KB by disabling seeking is not a trade, it is the opposite of the change.

The envelope: exactly two added keys
------------------------------------
A schema-3 line is its schema-1 record verbatim, plus:

``record_kind``
    Which collection the record came from, because a timeline-stream shard interleaves events,
    phases and edges in one time-ordered sequence and a reader must be able to tell them apart.
    Three separate files per day would avoid the field and cost three fetches to draw one day.

``at_ms``
    The instant the record enters the timeline: `at_ms` for an event (already present, and
    asserted to agree), `start_ms` for a phase, `min(source_ms, target_ms)` for an edge,
    `start_ms` for an activity bin. This is the sidecar's `timestamp_key`.

Adding a key that a record already carries would silently overwrite schema-1 data, so the writer
*refuses* rather than clobbers -- including the case where an event's own `at_ms` disagrees with
where the projection placed it, which is a disagreement worth a crash rather than a silent
correction. Removing `record_kind`, and removing `at_ms` from every kind but `event` (which
carried it in schema 1), recovers the schema-1 record byte for byte. That is a property
`test_timeline_v3.py` asserts over every collection, not a claim made here.

Records are assigned to one shard, not duplicated into every day they span
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Schema 2 appends a phase or an edge to every UTC day its interval intersects, so a day shard is
self-sufficient. Schema 3 assigns each record to the single day containing its `at_ms`, and each
shard entry in the bootstrap publishes ``t_end_exclusive``: the smallest instant at which nothing
in the shard is still live. A reader rendering ``[T0, T1)`` selects shards where
``t0 < T1 and t_end_exclusive > T0``, which is one pass over a list of 72 entries it already holds.

**Everything here is half-open, including the records.** That is the whole content of the field
name, and it is stated because getting it half-right is the natural mistake. A phase is
``[start_ms, end_ms)`` -- 8,342 of the archive's 9,984 adjacent same-agent phase pairs have one
phase's ``end_ms`` exactly equal to the next one's ``start_ms``, and none overlap -- and an
activity bin is the same shape, so their reach is ``end_ms`` unadjusted. An event and an edge are
*points*, and a point at ``a`` is live over ``[a, a + 1)`` at millisecond resolution, so their
reach is one past the last instant they occupy. An earlier draft padded the edge and not the
event, which made the published rule right for edges and off by one for events: a shard whose
newest record was an event at exactly ``T0`` failed ``t_end_exclusive > T0`` and was skipped,
losing a record inside the window.

The rule also names ``t0``, which is what a catalog entry publishes. An earlier draft named
``start_ms``, a field the entry does not carry at all, so no reader could have implemented the
rule as written. `test_timeline_v3.py` recomputes the reach per shard from the records and
asserts the published value, so neither half can drift again.

Measured, the choice costs nothing today: of 11,899 phases, the 49,542 non-structural edges and
379,006 events that make up the timeline stream, **0 cross a UTC midnight** -- phases are capped
at 1,800,000 ms and aligned, and the longest edge spans 5,146,972 ms without happening to straddle
one. That zero is a half-open zero, and it is worth saying which: 163 phases *end* exactly on a
UTC midnight, so under a closed reading they would each straddle a boundary by a single instant
they are not live for. It is not structurally impossible, so the
decision is made on principle rather than on the zero: duplication makes the index's
`record_count` stop meaning "records", makes `tail` able to return a record the caller already
has, and makes "schema 3 is a faithful re-encoding of schema 1" a claim needing an asterisk. The
differential in :mod:`agent_team_timeline.losslessness` compares record *sets*; a projection that
emits one record twice is one the differential has to be taught to forgive.

Three streams
-------------
``timeline``  ``data/timeline-v3/timeline/<team>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.jsonl.gz``
    Events, phases and non-structural edges: everything with a position on the time axis and
    enough volume to be worth seeking into. 93% of schema 3's bytes.

``spine``  ``data/timeline-v3/spine/<team>.jsonl.gz``
    The per-team records that have no single instant, or that a reader needs *all* of before it
    can draw anything: the team record, agents, phase cards, structural edges
    (`spawn`/`continuation`/`result` -- the spawn tree is a graph, and fetching it a day at a
    time to draw it whole is the wrong shape), rollups, projects, summary files, glossary terms,
    the project overview, and the derived zoom bounds of :data:`_ACTIVITY_BOUNDS_KIND`.

    **The spine deliberately carries no `at_ms`.** Its shards are addressed by *line range*, not
    by time: records are grouped by kind in :data:`_SPINE_KIND_ORDER` and the bootstrap publishes
    each kind's `[l0, n)`, so "just the agents" is one
    :meth:`~seekable_jsonl.SeekableJsonlReader.read_lines` call reading the members those lines
    fall in. Giving spine records a timestamp would make `read_range` *appear* to work on them
    and then quietly under-return -- an agent alive across the whole window has one `start_ms`,
    which is outside almost every window a reader will ask about. A stream with no time axis
    should say so rather than offer a broken one. Agents and rollups keep their own
    `start_ms`/`end_ms`; there are 2,555 agents in the whole archive, so a reader filters them in
    memory.

    One file per team rather than one file per (team, kind): 10 kinds times 12 teams is 120
    mostly tiny files, each with its own sidecar, and the line-range door already exists.

    This is the stream every command-line question is answered from, and it is 2,412,120 bytes
    of a 38,288,394-byte generation. Its shards are the only ones `query.py` opens.

``bins``  ``data/timeline-v3/bins.jsonl.gz``
    Activity bins, all teams, sorted by `(at_ms, ...)` and therefore bisectable.

Three more, for search
----------------------
``search``  ``data/timeline-v3/search/<team>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.jsonl.gz``
    The transcript search records: one per textual event and one condensed line per tool run,
    exactly the records :func:`agent_team_timeline.search_index.build_search_records` produces.

``search_bloom``  ``data/timeline-v3/search-bloom/<team>.jsonl.gz``
    One record per ``search`` shard, carrying that shard's trigram Bloom filter. The prefilter.

``search_links``  ``data/timeline-v3/search-links/<team>.jsonl.gz``
    The relationship sidecar: prompt excerpts and response->prompt edges, grouped by kind with
    published line ranges like the spine.

These three exist only when the build has search records to publish; an archive without them
carries the original three streams and nothing else, and the reader falls back to schema 2's
corpus for exactly that case.

The search streams: what was kept, and what was decided again
-------------------------------------------------------------
The prior corpus is described in `ai_docs/TRANSCRIPT_SEARCH_CASE_STUDY.md`, which is a dated
investigation record with its own measurements: on a seven-team website, 246,155 records in 53
team/day objects, 333.96 MB of identity JSON, a 3.87 MB bootstrap holding about 2.93 million
base64 characters of Bloom data, and a broad query that selected 50 of those 53 shards. On the
larger archive measured here the same shape is 313,839 records in 72 team/day objects: 422.4 MiB
of text objects, 13.0 MiB of linkage sidecars, 4,527,592 base64 characters of Bloom in a
5,702,530-byte bootstrap, and 509.1 MiB once the ``.gz`` twin of every object is counted.

That design was right, and every part of it is kept: the ``(team, UTC day)`` axis, the
definite-miss prefilter, the compact relationship sidecars, and the record shape down to the
field. What changed is the substrate underneath it, and three decisions had to be made again
against it.

**1. A stream, not a parallel structure.** The corpus becomes three schema-3 streams rather than
staying content-addressed objects beside them. The axis is not a coincidence to be exploited --
schema 3 chose ``(team, UTC day)`` *because* the corpus had already chosen it (see "Sharding
axis" above) -- so this is the two halves finally sharing one scheme, one reader, one stale-file
rule and one `gc` category. Staying parallel was considered and refused on three counts, none of
them aesthetic: content-addressed names force the ``data/timeline-v2/manifest.json`` reachability
file that schema 3 deliberately does not have (see "Stale shards" below); the objects are
pretty-printed with a ``.gz`` twin, which is 17% of the bytes buying nothing plus a full second
copy, and removing exactly that duplication is why schema 3 exists; and a reader would keep two
seek implementations for one sharding axis, which is how the two drift.

Folding the records into the existing ``timeline`` stream instead -- one more ``record_kind`` on
the day shard that already holds that day's events -- was the closer call, and it is refused for
the number this whole layout turns on: the timeline stream is 93% of schema 3's bytes and
`query.py` opens it for nothing. A search would then have to inflate members packed with phases,
edges and full event records to reach message text, and every day-render would drag the condensed
tool corpus. The two collections are also not the same records: a search record is a *derived*
projection -- parent/child route classification, prompt linkage, the child-attributed agent, the
condensed one-line tool text, the placeholder that stands in for an encrypted body -- and the
half of it that is tool runs does not appear in the timeline stream at all.

**2. The prefilter moved out of the bootstrap and became skippable.** Schema 2 inlines every
shard's Bloom filter into ``data/timeline-v2.json``: 4,527,592 base64 characters, which is most of
why that file is 5,702,530 bytes. Schema 3's bootstrap is 168,703 bytes -- 89,298 of it before
these streams existed -- and the entire point of that number is that a first frame, a `list`, a
`stats` and a `show` all cost one parse of it. Inlining the blooms would multiply it by twenty-six
and charge every one of those commands for a prefilter only `search` can use, so it is refused
outright.

The prefilter is nonetheless **kept**, against the case study's own evidence that it often cannot
prune: "common project terms such as KVM, DBI, and ptrace occur on nearly every active day", and
the acceptance query selected 50 of 53 shards. That is the argument for not paying for it *up
front*; it is not an argument for deleting it, because the same page records the other side --
"a rare definite-miss query selected eight shards and completed in about three seconds" against
about ten for the common one. A filter that is useless for the top hundred terms of a project and
decisive for everything else is worth having, as long as nothing but a search pays for it.

So it is its own stream, one shard per team, read only when a query actually has a term the
filter can act on. Two consequences fall out that schema 2 could not have:

* A query whose only term is shorter than a trigram -- ``B3``, the case study's own acceptance
  query -- reads **no** Bloom data at all, where schema 2 parsed all 4.5 MB of it out of the
  bootstrap and then skipped every filter. Same result, none of the cost.
* A ``--team`` search reads one team's filters instead of the archive's.

The two rejected placements are worth naming. *Per-shard headers in the seekable sidecar* cannot
work: to prune a shard you must not open it, and a shard's sidecar is only read when it is. *One
global bloom shard* (the shape ``bins`` uses) works and is simpler by one axis, but it makes a
one-team search read twelve teams' filters, so the team axis is kept. Putting the filters inside
the ``search_links`` shard -- collapsing three new streams into two -- was also measured rather
than dismissed: a team's filters are about 375 KB and its links about 1.1 MiB, so they would share
the first ~1 MiB member and reading the filters alone would inflate roughly 625 KB per team of
relationships nobody has asked for yet. Two files keep the prefilter's cost equal to the
prefilter, which is the property that makes "was it worth it" a question anybody can answer.

**3. The relationship sidecars keep their semantics, and change only their shape.** The case
study earns these: Codex records a child's return on the *receiving parent's* rollout, so the
author of a response is not the thread the record sits on; and a sliced export can hold a response
whose ``prompt_ref`` names a prompt outside the exported range, which ``prompt_in_scope`` records
so a client shows "unavailable" instead of treating it as corruption. Both live in the record
itself, which is copied verbatim -- ``prompt_ref``, ``prompt_at_ms``, ``prompt_author_kind`` and
``prompt_in_scope`` are not derived again here and are not dropped.

The sidecar exists for a separate reason the case study also earns: after the prefilter has pruned
a text shard, a matched record may still need the excerpt of a prompt that lived in the pruned
shard -- "text-shard pruning could hide a previous-day prompt or later-day response". So the
prompt excerpts and the response->prompt edges are published apart from the text, and read whole
for the selected teams. Because they are read whole and never pruned, per-day sharding buys
nothing and costs a file and a sidecar per day; they are **one shard per team**, laid out like the
spine -- ``search_prompt`` then ``search_response``, each with a published ``[l0, n)`` -- so a
search that matched no prompt reads only the response range and one that needs no excerpt reads
only the prompt range. The write-amplification argument that cuts the timeline stream at the day
does not reach here: a team's whole linkage is about 1.1 MiB against the 5,335,449 bytes that
argument was made about.

What the search streams cost, measured
--------------------------------------
Built from the measured archive's own 313,839 search records -- the same records, through the same
`search_index.build_search_records` output that schema 2 was written from, so the two rows below
describe one corpus in two formats and not two corpora::

    schema 2   509.1 MiB   290 files   456,602,389 bytes of pretty-printed objects
                                       + 68,198,724 of `.gz` twins
                                       + a 5,702,530-byte bootstrap (and its 3,289,110-byte twin)
    schema 3    67.0 MiB   192 files    65,424,198 compressed (398,200,779 uncompressed)
                                       +  3,196,750 prefilter
                                       +  1,550,719 relationships
                                       +     94,015 of sidecars

**13.2% of schema 2**, and the three parts are worth reading separately. The text is 65,424,198
bytes against 456,602,389 + 68,198,724 -- minified, gzipped once, with no plain twin, which is the
same three changes schema 3 made to the presentation timeline and the same reason each. The
relationships are 1,550,719 against 13.0 MiB of identity JSON. The prefilter is 3,196,750 bytes,
and it barely compresses at all, because base64 of Bloom bits is close to incompressible -- 4.5 MB
of it in schema 2's bootstrap became 3.2 MB in a stream nothing but a search opens.

The bootstrap goes from **89,298 bytes to 168,703**, and that is the price every other command
pays: 96 more catalogue entries, +79,405 bytes, 1.9x. It is the number to watch if the corpus ever
gains a fourth stream, and it is 1.5% of what schema 2's bootstrap cost the same commands.

Against the whole schema-3 generation the corpus is now the larger half: 70,265,682 bytes of
search beside 38,132,810 of presentation timeline. That is not a regression, it is where the bytes
always were -- the same corpus was 509.1 MiB of the 1,434.2 MiB schema-2 tree.

**Reading it: 6.4 times fewer bytes, and about the same wall clock.** Six queries run against the
measured archive through both generations returned byte-identical result pages, at::

    query                      schema 2                    schema 3
    backend maturity B3        464,540,111 B / 12.6 s       72,691,268 B / 13.2 s
    B3                         464,678,069 B / 12.2 s       69,514,861 B / 12.7 s
    KVM                        464,390,410 B / 14.9 s       72,670,442 B / 15.1 s
    ptrace strict-verify       463,423,554 B / 12.5 s       72,531,066 B / 13.2 s
    detlog ordinals            460,313,751 B / 12.4 s       72,176,207 B / 13.0 s
    a term nothing contains     73,251,093 B /  1.9 s       14,675,471 B /  1.9 s

The wall clock is recorded because leaving it out would be a claim by omission. It does not
improve, and on a warm page cache it is very slightly worse: both generations spend nearly all of
their time in `json.loads` over the same ~400 MB of records, and schema 3 adds an inflate that
schema 2 did not pay because it served the plain twin. What moves is the I/O, by 6.4x, which is
the number that decides a cold cache, a network mount and a browser -- and the disk, by 7.6x,
which is the number that decides whether the schema-2 generation can be reclaimed at all.

Where the activity bins went, and why the bootstrap is small
------------------------------------------------------------
Schema 2's bootstrap is 5,702,530 bytes, and it is that size because `activity_bins` is inlined:
2,059 pre-aggregated bins, 811,708 bytes minified, pretty-printed and then published in the one
file a browser must have in hand before it can render its first frame. Schema 3 moves them to
their own shard.

The objection to answer is "the overview needs the bins immediately". It does -- one round trip
later, from a shard that gzips to a fraction of its 812 KB, while the frame that shows the teams,
the range and the shard catalogue has already painted. The bins also grow as
`days x teams x resolutions x roles`, so inlining them makes the *entry point* the fastest-growing
file in the archive; everything else in the bootstrap grows with the shard count. A bootstrap
whose size is set by the largest pre-aggregation it happens to carry is not a bootstrap.

They are one shard rather than one per team, sorted by instant across all teams, because the
overview draws every team at once: per-team bins would be 12 fetches for the first chart, and the
global sort keeps the shard bisectable so a reader zoomed into a window reads only that window.

The bootstrap itself is written **plain and pretty**, as one JSON object at
``data/timeline-v3.json``, with no `.gz` twin. That is a deliberate exception to "compressed
only": at the measured size the twin would save tens of kilobytes against a shard set measured in
tens of megabytes, the duplication being removed is 2.42 GB of `.json` beside 0.19 GB of `.gz`
and not this, transfer compression is the wire's job, and the entry point is the one file that
must stay readable by `jq`, by a human diffing a rebuild, and by a browser with no decoder wired
up yet. Pretty-printing it costs about 17% of a file that is three orders of magnitude smaller
than the data it describes.

Stale shards, and why there is no reachability manifest
-------------------------------------------------------
Schema 2 needs `data/timeline-v2/manifest.json` because its object names are digests: nothing in
a directory listing says which objects the current generation reaches, so the writer maintains a
second file that does, plus a scope rule so a partial render does not delete another team's
objects. Schema 3 names shards by `(stream, team, day)`, so the bootstrap *is* the reachability
set, and :attr:`TimelineV3Report.generated_files` hands it to the caller's existing stale-file
removal -- `render._remove_stale_presentation_files` and `multi_team._remove_stale_files` -- which
already own that job for every other generated path. One fewer file, one fewer invariant.

Publication order is unchanged and load-bearing: every shard and every sidecar exists before the
bootstrap that names them is written.

**The writer owns the directory, and empties it of everything it did not just write.** After the
bootstrap is published, :func:`write_timeline_v3` removes every shard-shaped file under
``data/timeline-v3/`` outside its own plan, and `rmdir`s what that empties. Handing the job to the
caller's manifest-driven removal alone is not enough, and the gap is not hypothetical: that
removal reaps `previous - current` out of ``data/export.json``, which is written *after* this
function returns, so shards published by a build that died before its own bootstrap are in no
manifest's `previous` and no manifest's `current`. Nothing would ever name them again.

That leftover matters far beyond the disk it occupies, because absence from the catalogue is not
by itself evidence of death: a shard the catalogue does not name is a *retired team's* shard if
the bootstrap beside it is newer, and a *live team's* shard if the bootstrap is older, and the two
are indistinguishable from the outside. A sweeper that guessed would eventually guess "retired"
about the better half of a rebuild. Making the publisher clear its own tree removes the ambiguity
at the only point where it is not a guess -- here, where the plan is known -- and lets both the
reader (rule 5 of :class:`agent_team_timeline.query._SchemaThreeArchive`) and
:mod:`agent_team_timeline.archive_gc` treat any leftover as one unambiguous fact: a build was
interrupted, and the remedy is to run one.

Only files matching the two shapes this module emits are removed, and never through a symlink, so
"owns the directory" means the output it produces and not whatever an operator put beside it.

What it costs, measured
-----------------------
Three write paths over the same schema-1 input -- one team's records sliced out of the archive and
handed to `_write_compressible_json`, `write_timeline_shards` and `write_timeline_v3` in turn --
counting every file each one leaves on disk::

    input                        v1 (json+gz)   v2 (objects+gz)   v3 (shards+index+bootstrap)
    one mid-sized team             13,615,030        14,033,360                     1,002,954
      27,815 records                     2 files          17 files                     15 files
    the largest team              118,048,747       124,230,844                    19,146,119
      178,685 records                    2 files          51 files                     49 files

That is **7.4%** of schema 1 and **7.1%** of schema 2 on the mid-sized team; 16.2% and 15.4% on
the largest, where a third of the bytes are message bodies that were always going to dominate.
Against the two older generations together, schema 3 is 3.6% and 7.9%.

Over the whole archive schema 3's *presentation* half is 38,288,394 bytes in 171 files -- 72
timeline shards totalling 35,655,306 compressed bytes, 12 spine shards totalling 2,412,120, one
65,384-byte bins shard, their sidecars, and the bootstrap, measured at 89,298 bytes here because
the search streams did not exist yet; they take it to 168,703 and add 192 files of their own, and
"The search streams" above accounts for both. Against schema 2's 5,702,530-byte bootstrap either
number is a rounding error. The sidecars are
66,286 bytes of that, 0.17%, which is the number the phrase "a roughly fixed fraction of the shard
set" refers to wherever it appears. Against the generations it sits beside: schema 1 is
280,971,189 bytes in 2 files and schema 2 is 1,503,831,881 in 661, so schema 3 is **13.6% of
schema 1, 2.5% of schema 2, and 2.1% of the two together** -- 1.79 GB against 38 MB.

478,007 records, of which 463,423 are the schema-1 timeline re-encoded and 14,584 are the derived
zoom bounds. Those cost 324,624 bytes, 0.85% of the generation, and they are 0.02% of what schema
1 and schema 2 occupy between them; the recomputation they replace would have read tens of
megabytes of the timeline stream per zoom.

That the timeline stream is 93% of the generation is the number the read path turns on: no
question `query.py` asks opens it. Every list, show, search and stats answer comes out of the
2,412,120-byte spine, and a one-team answer out of one team's share of it.

Determinism
-----------
Two builds over identical input produce identical bytes; two builds in separate processes under
different ``PYTHONHASHSEED`` values over the measured archive produced byte-identical trees across
all 171 files, and a third build in place reported `files_changed == 0`. Records are encoded with
sorted keys and compact separators; shards are iterated in sorted order; members carry `mtime=0` through
:func:`static_assets.deterministic_gzip`; day boundaries are UTC and depend on no configuration;
and every sort is total, tiebroken on the encoded line. :func:`seekable_jsonl.write_seekable_jsonl_lines`
replaces a file only when its bytes differ, so an unchanged rebuild churns nothing.

#: for six of its seven hours frames the hour rather than the seven. Schema 2 attaches those

#:
#: **They are published.** The alternative -- recompute them when a reader asks -- was weighed
#: and refused, and the reason is that the recomputation is the exact scan the bounds exist to
#: avoid. :func:`timeline_shards.activity_bounds` derives them from every phase's ``states``
#: array and every event and edge instant belonging to the agent; a reader answering "zoom to
#: this agent's lifetime" would therefore have to read every timeline shard the agent's
#: lifetime intersects -- for a long-lived agent, that is its team's entire stream, which is
#: 93% of schema 3's bytes. Publishing 14,584 small records to avoid re-reading tens of
#: megabytes is not a close call, and it is the trade schema 2 already made.
#:
#: The envelope is nonetheless intact, because these are **not** schema-1 records with two
#: extra keys: they are a derived kind of their own, like ``phase_card``, keyed by the
#: archive's stable reference. An ``agent`` line in a spine shard is still its schema-1 record
#: byte for byte, so the losslessness differential stays a comparison rather than a
