# =====================================================================================
# Reading a slice instead of a file
# =====================================================================================
#
# Everything between here and `TranscriptQuery` exists to make an answer cost the size of
# the *span the answer lives in* rather than the size of the file. That is deliberately a
# weaker claim than "the size of the answer", because one shape does not reach it and saying
# so here is cheaper than a reader discovering it with a stopwatch: `list_messages` can bound
# where a response scan *starts* (no response precedes the prompt it replies to) and cannot
# bound where it *ends* (a response may arrive arbitrarily later), so selecting the first few
# prompts of an archive and asking for their replies still walks the message projection to
# EOF unless a `--limit`, a `--tail` or a window end stops it. See `list_messages` for why no
# sound upper bound exists rather than merely not having been written yet.
#
# Two physical formats need slicing, and they get two readers rather than one, because they
# are genuinely different problems:
#
# `_ChunkedJsonlReader` reads a schema-3 shard -- a multi-member gzip file with the sidecar
# index written by `agent_team_timeline.seekable_jsonl`. It is a *reimplementation* of that
# module's reader, and the duplication is deliberate and load-bearing. This file is copied
# verbatim into every generated archive as the standalone `./timeline` executable, which is
# pinned by `test_bundled_query_source_runs_without_the_installed_package`: it runs with no
# `agent_team_timeline` package on the path, so it may import nothing but the standard
# library. The alternatives were to make the launcher a multi-file bundle (losing the single
# executable an archive owner can copy anywhere) or to concatenate modules at render time
# (a build step whose output nobody reads until it is broken). Instead the copy is pinned by
# a differential: `test_query_chunk_reader_matches_the_package_reader` asserts that this
# reader and `seekable_jsonl.SeekableJsonlReader` return the same records *and* read the same
# number of bytes from the same shard. A comment saying "keep these in sync" would not have
# survived the first divergence; a failing test will.
#
# `_SchemaThreeArchive`, below it, is what calls it: every list, show, search and stats path in
# this file now reads `data/timeline-v3.json` and its spine shards when a complete schema-3
# generation is present, and falls back to schema 2 and then schema 1 when it is not. See that
# class for the completeness rule and for which stream answers which question.
#
# `_SeekableJsonlText` reads the *uncompressed* transcript projections under
# `extracted/transcripts/`. Those have no sidecar and deliberately gain none: adding a
# chunked `.gz` twin beside them would recreate exactly the duplication schema 3 exists to
# remove (the archive already carries 2.42 GB of `.json` beside 0.19 GB of `.gz`), and it is
# unnecessary, because an uncompressed file sorted on its key can be binary-searched in
# place. The two invariants that makes sound are writer invariants, not lucky properties of
# today's data: `transcript_export` emits both files through `sorted(..., key=_record_sort_key)`
# whose first component is `timestamp_ms`, and assigns `ordinal` by `enumerate(prompts, 1)`
# over that same sorted list, so in `prompts.jsonl` the ordinal is exactly the line number
# plus one. Both are re-checked at the records a seek actually lands on, so a projection that
# ever stops honouring them fails loudly instead of silently returning the wrong window.

class _SchemaThreeArchive:
    """The schema-3 generation, opened lazily and read a line range at a time.

    What each question reads
    ------------------------
    Only the **spine** stream. Every question this file asks about the presentation timeline --
    which teams, which agents, which phases, which rollups, which project overviews, what a
    reference resolves to, how much summary text exists -- is answered from
    ``data/timeline-v3/spine/<team>.jsonl.gz``, and from one *line range* inside it rather than
    from the whole shard: the bootstrap publishes each kind's ``[first, count]``, so "the
    agents of one team" is a :meth:`_ChunkedJsonlReader.read_lines` call that inflates only the
    members those lines fall in. The **timeline** stream -- events, edges and full phases, 93%
    of schema 3's bytes -- is opened by none of them, and the **bins** stream only by
    :meth:`activity_bins`.

    That is not an oversight, it is the measurement: schema 2 answers the same questions from a
    ``global`` object and a ``phase_index`` object that together cost 25,692,901 bytes to open
    on the measured archive, unconditionally, before the first question is asked, because both
    are single JSON documents that must be parsed whole. The same questions against schema 3
    cost the 168,703-byte bootstrap plus the members the answer actually lives in. (89,298 of
    those bytes were the bootstrap before the search streams; the other 79,405 are their 96
    catalogue entries, and none of it is Bloom data -- schema 2 inlined 4.5 MB of that into the
    file every command reads.)

    Completeness, and why it is checked this way
    --------------------------------------------
    :meth:`open` returns ``None`` and a reason rather than raising, because reading a *partial*
    schema-3 generation as if it were whole is worse than not reading it at all: a listing that
    silently omits a team is indistinguishable from a team that did no work. The rule is:

    1. ``data/timeline-v3.json`` is a regular file (not a symlink), parses, and declares
       ``schema_version == 3`` and ``kind == "timeline-v3-bootstrap"``.
    2. Its ``codec`` block names a container, timestamp key, record-kind key and index suffix
       this reader implements. A future writer that changes any of them gets a fallback, not a
       misreading.
    3. It names all three streams, and every shard entry in them resolves to a path inside
       ``data/timeline-v3/``, is a regular file, is **exactly** ``c_bytes`` long, and has a
       sidecar beside it that is also a regular file.
    4. The set of teams named by spine shards equals the set of team slugs the bootstrap
       inlines. Every team gets a spine shard from the writer -- it always emits at least the
       ``team`` record -- so an inequality here is a generation that lost a shard.
    5. The converse of 3: every shard-shaped file **on disk** under ``data/timeline-v3/`` is
       named by the catalogue. Nothing published there is unaccounted for.

    Rules 1-5 cost one parse of the bootstrap -- 168,703 bytes -- one walk of a machine-owned
    directory tree, and two ``stat`` calls per shard: 181 shards on the measured archive once it
    carries the search streams, so 362 calls, against 85 shards and 170 calls before them. That
    is why they can run before every query rather than behind a flag.

    They rest on the writer's publication order, which is load-bearing and stated in
    :mod:`agent_team_timeline.timeline_v3`: every shard and sidecar is written before the
    bootstrap that names them, and the bootstrap is replaced atomically. So the bootstrap
    existing implies the shards existed when it was written, and rules 3 and 4 catch the cases
    that fact does not cover -- a rebuild interrupted after rewriting a shard and before
    rewriting the bootstrap, a copy that stopped halfway, a shard deleted since.

    **Rule 5 is there because rules 1-4 cannot see a shard the bootstrap does not mention, and
    that is the direction of partial publication that loses a team.** Publication is
    shards-then-bootstrap with no atomicity across the set, so a build that adds a team and dies
    between the last spine shard and the bootstrap leaves the *previous* generation's bootstrap
    in place: every file it names is present at its declared length, rule 4 compares two sets
    that both come out of that same bootstrap, and the new team's shards sit on disk unread. The
    reader would answer from the older catalogue and omit a team the archive plainly has -- and
    `data/timeline-v2.json`, written earlier in the same build, would list it, so the website and
    ``./timeline`` would disagree about how many teams exist. Rule 5 turns that into a fallback
    to schema 2, which is the generation that does have the team.

    Only *shard-shaped* names count -- ``*.jsonl.gz`` and ``*.jsonl.gz.index.jsonl``, the two
    file shapes the writer emits. A stray note or an editor's scratch file under the root is
    ignored rather than costing the archive its fast read path, and a symlink is skipped for the
    same reason it is skipped everywhere else here: the bootstrap decides what this process
    opens, not the tree. The writer removes its own strays (see
    :func:`agent_team_timeline.timeline_v3.write_timeline_v3`), so on an archive built by a
    completed run rule 5 has nothing to find; when it does find something, a rebuild is the
    remedy and `gc` says so rather than sweeping it.

    **The honest limit is a rewrite that preserves length.** The bootstrap also publishes
    ``c_sha256`` and ``u_sha256`` per shard, and neither is checked here, because checking them
    means reading all 38,288,394 bytes to answer a question that costs 300 KB -- which is the
    entire property schema 3 exists to provide. The three cheap agreement checks
    :class:`_ChunkedJsonlReader` already makes on every shard it opens (the sidecar names this
    file, the sidecar's ``c_size`` equals the file's length, and each member inflates to exactly
    the length the sidecar claims) narrow the gap further, and turn a stale sidecar into an
    error at the exact member rather than a confident wrong answer. What remains uncaught is a
    same-length substitution, which is the same limit the transcript projections' size check
    has, and `test_query_read_paths.py` pins it there rather than letting a docstring overstate
    it.

    **The cross-generation check is deferred, not skipped.** Whether schema 3 and schema 2
    describe the same source generation is only answerable by reading schema 2's bootstrap --
    5,702,530 bytes on the measured archive, sixty-five times the size of schema 3's, and
    exactly the file schema 3 exists to stop opening. So it is checked at the one place the two
    generations are used *together*: an archive whose schema 3 predates the ``search`` streams
    answers a transcript search out of schema 2's corpus while the phases and agents around it
    come from schema 3, so :meth:`TimelineQuery._search_bootstrap` refuses a ``source_digest``
    mismatch at the moment it opens that corpus -- where the schema-2 bootstrap is being read
    anyway and the comparison is free. On an archive whose schema 3 *does* carry the corpus there
    is nothing left to check: both halves come from this bootstrap.

    **What the search streams add.** Three optional streams -- ``search``, ``search_bloom`` and
    ``search_links`` -- carry the transcript search corpus when the build published one. They are
    the only streams this class reads besides the spine, and they are read only by a search: see
    :meth:`search_shards`, :meth:`search_blooms` and :meth:`search_links`, and
    `timeline_v3`'s module docstring for why they are three rather than one.

        whole. Every record in it would then be silently absent from the result, with no error
        and no diagnostic: the exact shape of wrong answer this reader refuses elsewhere.

        The writer derives the path from the bucket it is filtering, so nothing produces this

class TranscriptQuery:
    """Validated read-only access to the zero-model transcript projection.

    **What this class stopped doing, and why.** It used to SHA-256 all four managed files in
    its constructor -- 227,545,190 bytes on the measured archive -- and then materialize two
    of them with ``read_text().splitlines()``. Every query paid all of it: ``messages --range
    3978-3980`` read 339,828,416 bytes at 994,996,224 bytes of resident memory and returned
    nine records, and its cost was byte-identical to ``--range 1`` because the filtering
    happened after full materialization. Of what it hashed, 115,261,964 bytes -- the
    occurrence log and the system-input projection -- are consulted by no query at all.

    The same three questions now cost 3,054,373 bytes, 65,536 bytes and zero: the range read
    seeks to its span, ``--tail 20`` reads one backwards block, and constructing this object
    reads nothing whatsoever. `test_query_read_paths.py` asserts each of those as a bound on
    :attr:`bytes_read` rather than as a duration.

    Now nothing is read until a query asks for it, and what a query asks for is a slice.

    **The integrity contract, restated honestly**, because it did change and pretending
    otherwise would be worse than the change:

    * At open, every managed file is checked for existence, for not being a symlink, and --
      where the manifest declares one -- for its exact byte count. That is four ``stat``
      calls and it catches the failure the constructor's digest loop was written to catch: a
      generation interrupted midway, or a file appended to after the manifest was written.
      All four, not just the two a query consults: a truncated ``occurrences.jsonl`` says the
      generation is damaged whether or not this particular question would have read it, and
      an open that only checked what it intended to read would report a healthy archive while
      holding the evidence that it is not.
    * A query that reads a file *end to end* verifies its digest in full, folded over bytes
      it was reading anyway, so it costs nothing. ``stats`` and an unfiltered ``prompts``
      still fail closed exactly as before.
    * A query that reads a *slice* verifies the byte count and the structure of the records
      it returns, and does not reproduce the whole-file digest -- it never read the whole
      file. ``verify=True`` (``--verify`` on the command line) restores the complete check on
      demand, for the reader who wants the old guarantee at the old price.
    * A manifest written before the per-file ``bytes`` field existed declares no size, so
      there is nothing to check with a ``stat``; such a file gets the complete digest check on
      first use instead. Degrading to "no check" there would silently weaken exactly the
      oldest archives, which is the one direction this change must not go.

    **What a slice read does not promise.** An equal-length rewrite of bytes no query touched
    is invisible to a size check, and no amount of seeking will see it -- that is what
    ``--verify`` is for, and why the bullet above says which measurement each path made rather
    than claiming one guarantee for both.

        **Where the message read starts, and why that is sound.** A response is emitted only
        when its ``in_reply_to_prompt_id`` names a selected prompt, so the scan can begin at
        the earliest selected prompt's instant instead of at byte zero. That rests on one
        writer invariant: ``transcript_export._response_records`` links a response only to a
        prompt occurrence at or before the response's own instant, and both projections are
        sorted on that instant. The narrow gap is a logical prompt with several occurrences
        whose *representative* occurrence -- the earliest one carrying an authorship
        classification -- is later than the occurrence a response was actually linked to; on
        the measured archive that is 0 of 4,043 prompts, but it is not structurally
        impossible. ``verify=True`` therefore does not merely re-digest: it also abandons this
        lower bound and resolves linkage by full scan, so the reader who will not rely on an
        invariant the archive only promises has a way to say so.

        When a time window is set, the lower bound is the window's own start instead, which
        rests on nothing at all -- a message outside the window is dropped by ``_selected``
        regardless of what it replies to.

        **There is a lower bound and no upper one, and that asymmetry is structural.** The
        invariant above is one-sided: a response is linked to a prompt occurrence at or before
        its own instant, and *nothing* bounds how long after that instant it arrives. So the
        scan can start late and cannot stop early. Selecting the last few prompts of an
        archive therefore costs almost nothing -- the lower bound does all the work, and
        ``--range 3978-3980`` on the measured archive reads 3,054,373 bytes of a 105,453,039
        byte projection -- while selecting the *first* few costs the whole projection:
        ``--range 1-3`` reads all of it, because ``lower`` is the first prompt's instant and
        there is no instant after which a reply to prompt 1 becomes impossible.

        Three ways to bound the top were considered. Stopping at the last selected prompt's
        instant is wrong by construction, since that is precisely where the replies begin.
        Stopping once every selected prompt has been seen replied to assumes one reply per
        prompt, which the projection does not promise. Recording a per-prompt "last reply"
        offset in the manifest would work and is a change to ``transcript_export``, not to a
        reader, so it is not smuggled in here. What *is* honoured is the caller's own bound:
        ``--limit`` stops the scan the moment it has enough, ``--tail`` runs backwards from
        the end instead, and a window end caps it. An unbounded question over an early
        selection reads to EOF, and the section comment above says so rather than leaving it
        to be measured.

        Deferring it costs nothing: the file is being read anyway, and the comparison is a
        string.

        The mismatch is a refusal rather than a fallback. Two generations of one archive
        disagreeing about their source is not something a reader can paper over by picking one:
        the phases would come from one build and the messages from another, and the linkage
        between them -- which phase a message falls inside -- would be silently wrong.

        substrate rather than from a change of mind.

        First, only the halves the caller needs are read: excerpts are fetched only when some
        matched record cites a prompt, and edges only when some matched record *is* a prompt whose
        replies have to be counted. Schema 2 reads both, because a content-addressed object is
        indivisible; a line range is not.

        Second, a response's instant is checked against the days the ``search`` stream actually
        publishes for that team rather than against the one day a per-day sidecar would have been
        cut to. That is the same check -- "this edge belongs to a shard of this corpus" -- restated
        for a per-team file, and it is why the day set is built here rather than assumed.
