"""Where a team's build state lives, and how an existing archive moves it there.

Every number below was measured on 2026-08-25 against one archive, read-only.

This is the second half of a separation :mod:`agent_team_timeline.snapshot_store` started. That
module moved the *vendor input* out of the published directory. This one moves the *intermediate
output*: the normalized team, the artifact catalogue it was extracted from, the provenance
manifests, and the payload store. On the measured archive that is **717 MiB of a 1.5 GiB
archive**, none of which any consumer of the archive opens:

===============================================  ========  =====================================
``teams/<slug>/raw/team.json``                    717 MiB  the normalized team, rewritten each ingest
``teams/<slug>/raw/artifacts.json``                        the catalogue the presentation comes from
``teams/<slug>/raw/source-manifest.json``                  which vendor bytes produced the above
``teams/<slug>/raw/normalized-generation.json``            what the normalizer was when it ran
``teams/<slug>/raw/task-notes.jsonl``                      notes promoted out of the snapshot store
``teams/<slug>/payloads/``                          0 B    tool text ``raw/team.json`` points at
===============================================  ========  =====================================

Both tenants are *regenerable*: they are what ingestion computes from the snapshot store, so
losing them costs CPU and nothing else. They are relocated rather than dropped because they are
also what makes an incremental ingest incremental -- the append-only guards compare against
``source-manifest.json``, and the renderer reads ``team.json`` without re-reading a single vendor
byte. Deleting them after each build would turn every rebuild into a full re-ingest.

What stays inside the archive, and why
--------------------------------------

``teams/<slug>/summaries/`` is rendered Markdown -- 13 MiB that the shipped ``timeline`` CLI reads
for ``stats`` and ``search``. It is output, and it is paid for. It stays.

``teams/<slug>/summary_data/`` -- 47 MiB of summary cache, name cache and glossary -- is
intermediate by every other measure and **is not moved here**, for one specific reason worth
recording rather than rediscovering. Nested inside its cache directory is ``_usage/``: 1,878
receipts recording every model call this archive ever paid for, which the shipped ``run_stats.py``
reads to report the 55,267,957 tokens the archive cost. Those receipts are not cache; they are the
record of the spend, they belong with the output, and they are the one thing here that cannot be
regenerated at any price.

So moving ``summary_data`` means first splitting the receipts out of the cache they happen to
live inside, which is a change to how two summarization backends address their own output. That
is its own change with its own risk, and it buys 47 MiB against the 717 MiB this store already
takes. Recorded here so the next person weighing it starts from the reason rather than the
symptom.

Where the default goes
----------------------

``<output>.build/`` -- a sibling of the published directory, named after it::

    /path/to/summary/widget             <- --output, published, served, shipped
    /path/to/summary/widget.sources/    <- the snapshot store, vendor input
    /path/to/summary/widget.build/      <- this, intermediate state

A sibling for the same reason the snapshot store is one: it is on the same filesystem in every
layout anyone actually has, so migrating an existing archive is ``os.replace`` per team -- atomic,
instant, and impossible to half-finish inside one team. See that module's own note for the full
argument; it applies here unchanged.

How a run finds the store
-------------------------

The same four branches, in the same order, for the same reasons:

1. ``--build-root`` on the command line, or ``build_root`` in a project config.
2. otherwise ``<output>/build-root.json``, written by the run that established the layout.
3. otherwise, if ``teams/<slug>/raw/`` is populated, *that* -- an archive built by an older tool
   keeps working, untouched, with no flag and no migration.
4. otherwise ``<output>.build/``.

Nothing here ever moves a file. An archive stays in the layout it has until an operator runs
``migrate-build-state``. Two disagreements are refusals rather than guesses:

* a requested root while **any** team in the archive still keeps its build state inside it. Asked
  of the archive rather than of the team being built, because "one archive, one layout" is a
  property of the archive.
* a pointer that says the store is external while *this team's* in-archive directory is still
  populated -- an interrupted migration, which reads as "finish it" rather than "start again", and
  which is asked per team so the teams already moved keep building while the rest wait.

The pointer file is inside ``--output``
---------------------------------------

``build-root.json`` is roughly two hundred bytes and it is the one thing about the build layout
that the published directory keeps. That looks like a contradiction of this module's own premise
and is not: a pointer is not intermediate progress. It exists so that an archive which has been
*moved* can still find the state belonging to it, which a derived ``<output>.build`` cannot
promise and an operator's memory should not have to. It costs the shipped artifact nothing
measurable, it is what :mod:`agent_team_timeline.snapshot_store` already does for the same reason,
and consistency between the two stores is worth more than two hundred bytes.
