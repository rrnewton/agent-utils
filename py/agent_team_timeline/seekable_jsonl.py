"""Chunked, seekable JSONL: a multi-member gzip file plus a codec-agnostic sidecar index.

The archive's problem, stated plainly: nothing in it is seekable. Reading three records out of
`extracted/transcripts/messages.jsonl` costs 328 MB of I/O and 950 MB of resident memory, because
filtering happens after full materialization. Everything below exists to make "the last twenty
records" and "everything between two timestamps" cost the size of the answer instead of the size
of the archive.

Container
---------
A **multi-member gzip file**. gzip's format is the concatenation of independently decodable
members, so a file that holds N members is still, to `gunzip`, `zcat`, `gzip -t`, `file(1)` and
`gzip.open`, an entirely ordinary `.gz`. Members are cut at the first LINE boundary at or after a
target of :data:`DEFAULT_TARGET_CHUNK_BYTES`, so a member always holds whole lines and no reader
ever has to reassemble a record that straddles a seek point.

The codec choice was measured on the real 101,584,237-byte `messages.jsonl` (63,844 records) and
is not a knob:

    codec     chunk   members        total   vs whole-file   index   1-chunk decompress
    gzip-6      64K     1,529   23,433,193          +8.39%   86,207B      0.1ms
    gzip-6     256K       387   22,094,090          +2.20%   22,583B      0.6ms

    gzip-6    4096K        25   21,650,576          +0.15%    1,523B      8.4ms
    zstd-19   1024K        97   17,465,144         +10.51%    5,832B      2.6ms
    xz-6      1024K        97   17,279,536          +8.18%   10,300B     10.3ms

gzip at ~1 MiB wins the argument that matters. Chunking costs it +0.56% -- effectively nothing --
because its 32 KiB window already makes its compression local, so cutting the stream throws away
almost no context it was using. The same cut costs zstd-19 10.5% and xz-6 8.2%, since those codecs
earn their smaller absolute size precisely by remembering megabytes back. Paying 24% more bytes to
keep a format every tool on every host already reads, and to keep the random-access tax near zero,
is the trade this archive wants: it is a durable record first and a transfer artifact second.

Re-measured with this implementation, on the same file as it stands today (103,895,486 bytes,
65,123 records): 99 members, 22,274,727 bytes, against 22,151,001 for the same input through
whole-file gzip-6 -- **+0.559%**, reproducing the audit's +0.56% to three digits. `gzip -t`
passes, `file(1)` reports plain "gzip compressed data", `gunzip -c` reproduces
83fae78b00f966441df58bd1d5a5b3fd82b58b19707c306b68a1a91b6403f779, which is byte for byte the
sha256 already recorded for `messages.jsonl` in `extracted/transcripts/manifest.json`. The
existing integrity contract survives chunking untouched, which is the whole reason the writer
has a lines-in/lines-out door as well as a records door.

Why a sidecar index and not something cleverer
----------------------------------------------
Three shapes were considered.

*Per-member gzip FEXTRA fields*, the BGZF trick. Rejected: Python's `gzip` module cannot write
FEXTRA, so we would be hand-rolling headers, which forfeits the one property this whole design is
built on -- that the container is produced by a boring writer and consumed by every existing tool.
And it does not even answer the question we need answered, because "which member holds t=X" would
still require walking every member header.

*An index appended after the final member.* Rejected: `gunzip` treats bytes after the last member
as trailing garbage and says so, which loses `gzip -t` cleanliness -- the exact property being
protected.

*A sidecar file.* Accepted. Its one real cost is that the pair can be separated, which is why
:class:`SeekableJsonlReader` degrades to a correct full scan when the index is absent, and why
:func:`rebuild_index` can reconstruct the index from the `.gz` alone. Losing the index costs
speed and nothing else, and that is the requirement, not an accident.

Index shape
-----------
The sidecar is itself JSONL: line 0 is a header object, lines 1..N are one object per member, in
file order. Pretty-printed whole-file JSON was rejected for the reason this module exists -- an
index you must materialize entirely before you can read a field is a small copy of the problem.
Line-per-member also keeps diffs local when an archive is rebuilt and checked in, and leaves the
door open to bisecting the index file itself the day an index stops fitting comfortably in memory.
(Today it fits easily. Run against the real `messages.jsonl`, this writer produces 99 members and
a 12,633-byte index -- 0.06% of the 22.3 MB it describes, or about 128 bytes a member, which is
what named keys and 13-digit epoch milliseconds cost. Extrapolated at 1 MiB chunks, an index over
the whole 8.79 GB archive lands near a megabyte.)

Header keys::

    format              "agent-team-timeline/seekable-jsonl-index"
    version             1
    codec               "gzip"      -- descriptive; the member entries are codec-agnostic
    codec_level         6
    target_chunk_bytes  the writer's cut threshold
    timestamp_key       record field the t0/t1 bounds were taken from
    timestamps_sorted   whether t0/t1 are non-decreasing across members (enables bisect)
    member_count, record_count
    c_size, u_size      total compressed and uncompressed bytes
    c_sha256, u_sha256  digests of the compressed file and of the uncompressed stream
    data_file           basename of the `.gz` this index describes

Member keys, one line each::

    c_off, c_len        byte range of the member within the compressed file
    u_off, u_len        byte range of the member within the uncompressed stream
    l0, n               first line number (0-based) and line count
    t0, t1              minimum and maximum timestamp in the member, or null

Nothing in a member entry mentions gzip. Swapping the codec later -- zstd with per-frame
independence, say -- changes the header's `codec`/`codec_level` and not one member field, which is
the point: the index describes *where things are*, and the header describes *how to inflate them*.
Only `codec`, `codec_level`, `target_chunk_bytes` and `timestamp_key` are unrecoverable from the
data; every other field :func:`rebuild_index` derives by walking the file.

That door is only real if the reader walks through it deliberately, so :class:`SeekableJsonlReader`
refuses a `codec` it does not implement with :class:`UnsupportedCodecError` instead of inflating
the members as gzip and hoping. A reader that ignored the field would accept a zstd-labelled index
today -- and on the day a zstd file appeared would report "member did not inflate", whose remedy is
to replace the data. Software older than its data must say so.

Per-member digests were considered and rejected. gzip already carries a CRC-32 per member, so a
corrupt member fails to inflate rather than returning wrong bytes, and the archive's existing
integrity contract is a single sha256 over the uncompressed stream, recorded in
`extracted/transcripts/manifest.json` -- which, as recorded above, a round trip through 99 members
reproduces byte for byte. Adding per-member digests would double the index and give a third,
differently-scoped answer to a question already answered twice.

Determinism
-----------
Two writes over the same input produce byte-identical output: members carry mtime=0 and no
filename, records are encoded with sorted keys and no spaces, and cuts depend only on byte counts.
The archive's whole idempotence story -- `write_text_if_changed`, and a checkout that does not
churn on a rebuild -- depends on that. Members are compressed through
:func:`agent_team_timeline.static_assets.deterministic_gzip` rather than
`zlib.compressobj(wbits=31)` because zlib stamps a platform-dependent OS byte into the header
(0x03 on Linux), which would make the same input produce different files on a build host and on a
laptop; Python's `gzip` module hardcodes 0xff, "unknown". Byte-identity is guaranteed for a fixed
zlib, which is what idempotence needs; a zlib upgrade may legitimately re-emit the file.

Known wart, worth knowing before someone files a bug: ``gzip -l`` reports only the LAST member's
ISIZE, so on a multi-member file it under-reports the uncompressed size. `gunzip`, `zcat`,
`gzip.open` and this module are all correct; `gzip -l` is the outlier, and always has been.

    an identical rebuild must not churn the mtime of a file that is checked in, or every rebuild
    looks like a change to everything downstream of it.

    The cost is one extra sequential read of the file already on disk, on top of the pass that
    produced the replacement. That is the cheap side of the trade: the comparison is streamed by
    `filecmp` and short-circuits on a size mismatch, whereas an unnecessary `os.replace` of a
    21 MB blob is a new inode, a new mtime, and a diff for whoever is watching the archive.

    **The sidecar is removed first, and only when the data is really being replaced.** Data and
    index are two files and cannot be published in one atomic step, so a crash, an ENOSPC or a
    kill between them leaves *some* pair on disk and the only choice is which pair. Unlinking
    first leaves new data with no index, which is the documented fallback: correct answers,
    linear reads, and `rebuild_index` restores the speed. The other order leaves new data beside
    an index describing the old, and the open-time check is a single comparison of total
    compressed size, so a change that does not move the size -- shifting every timestamp by one
    millisecond does not -- opens clean and then fails inside a member as a
    :class:`TruncatedArchiveError`, telling the operator to replace data that is perfectly good.
    `static_assets.write_text_with_gzip_invalidation` already reaches this conclusion for the
