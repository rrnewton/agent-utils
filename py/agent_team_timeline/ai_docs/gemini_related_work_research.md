# **Multi-Agent Execution Telemetry and Hierarchical Trajectory Summarization: A Comparative Architectural Analysis**

The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has precipitated a fundamental shift from single-turn, stateless language model invocations to complex, long-horizon multi-agent systems. In these advanced architectures, autonomous agents act as coordinators, spawning specialized sub-agents, delegating discrete tasks, and aggregating results across extended temporal windows. As these systems operate continuously—often running in "ultra" modes where heavy sub-agent teams are dynamically instantiated—tracking the execution lineage, isolating errors, and comprehending the overarching narrative of the machine's labor becomes profoundly difficult. The raw output is invariably an overwhelming stream of telemetry data, tool invocations, coordination noise, and redundant status updates, effectively obscuring the substantive progress of the system.
The proposed architecture—a static, idempotent, multi-level summarization engine utilizing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) timeline inspired by the Perfetto UI—addresses a critical void in the current observability ecosystem. By treating agent histories not merely as metric logs but as hierarchical narratives, the system seeks to bridge the gap between low-level telemetry and high-level human comprehension. This design explicitly separates the high-cost cognitive labor of large language models (summarization and classification) from the deterministic logic of data formatting and visualization. This report exhaustively analyzes the state of the art in multi-agent observability, trace visualization, recursive summarization, and trajectory compression, contextualizing the proposed system against contemporary frameworks and theoretical methodologies.

## **Telemetry Standards and the Event Representation Layer**

Before visual rendering or text-based summarization can occur, multi-agent activity must be captured via a standardized event representation. The proposed system necessitates distinguishing between periods when an agent is actively computing, waiting on an external tool, or sitting idle. Furthermore, it requires tracking the fork-join lifecycle of coordinator-spawned sub-agents, calculating aggregate statistics over specific temporal ranges, and outputting machine-readable schemas.
Historically, distributed tracing relied on frameworks like OpenTelemetry to track requests across microservices. However, general-purpose conventions lack the taxonomy required for artificial intelligence operations, such as multi-turn message arrays, system prompts, and tool definitions1. To address this, specialized semantic conventions have emerged, most notably the OpenTelemetry GenAI conventions and OpenInference3.

### **The OpenInference Semantic Taxonomy**

OpenInference establishes a rigorous taxonomy of operations tailored specifically for autonomous agents. Its conventions are built on OpenTelemetry but define a concrete attribute schema and span-kind taxonomy that maps directly to the tracking requirements of a multi-agent DAG1. The core span kinds defined by OpenInference provide the exact categorical boundaries required to render colored timeline blocks indicating agent states:

* **AGENT:** Represents a reasoning block that acts on tools using the guidance of a language model. This spans the entire lifecycle of a specific sub-agent's task execution, directly corresponding to the "starting point to end point" block of a sub-agent on the timeline5.
* **LLM:** Represents a direct call to an API, carrying input messages, model parameters, and token counts. This maps to the periods where the agent is actively generating text5.
* **TOOL:** Represents the execution of a function or external API invoked by the agent. This is critical for fulfilling the requirement to differentiate active reasoning from periods where the agent is waiting on tool execution (e.g., compilation, web search, bash execution, or git operations)5.
* **CHAIN:** Represents a deterministic sequence of operations or orchestration logic, often linking agents together in the coordinator-subagent paradigm5.

The proposed system's requirement to visualize active periods versus waiting periods relies fundamentally on extracting the temporal bounds of LLM and TOOL spans nested within an AGENT parent span. By adopting or parsing OpenInference-compliant JSON payloads, an offline processor can accurately delineate these sub-blocks, rendering them in distinct colors on the Gantt-style timeline.

### **Quantitative Extraction and Machine-Readable Statistics**

A core requirement of the proposed architecture is the extraction of quantitative metrics alongside qualitative summaries. The system must produce a machine-readable JSON file in an output directory that aggregates session-wide statistics. This includes the total number of raw messages, responses in the session transcript, word counts divided by user and AI generation, total token usage, and database task throughput (e.g., tasks opened versus closed).
Tracing frameworks naturally capture these metrics within span attributes. For instance, OpenInference standardizes token economics, tracking prompt tokens, completion tokens, and caching metrics as first-class operational variables1. By parsing the raw execution JSON, the proposed pipeline can sum these attributes across the entire session or within dynamically bounded time ranges. When a user zooms into a specific region of the timeline, the visualization interface can compute aggregates for that specific window—such as the number of active agents, total tool calls, or specific message types—providing a quantitative readout at the bottom of the screen that updates reactively to the viewport.

### **Idempotent Architecture and Token Economics**

The majority of contemporary agent observability platforms—such as LangSmith, Langfuse, and Arize Phoenix—rely on active database backends (like PostgreSQL or ClickHouse) to ingest telemetry streams in real-time7. For example, LangGraph utilizes specialized checkpointer libraries to maintain state and enable runtime recovery, storing each channel value separately to minimize database roundtrips9.
In contrast, the proposed architecture mandates a purely static, version-controlled, and idempotent data model. This approach dictates that the summarization pipeline runs as a batch process, reading raw trace logs (e.g., from Codex, Claude, fbcode/orc, or gas-town), executing inference to generate summaries, and outputting static JSON and Markdown files.
This static accumulation model offers distinct advantages for archival stability and token cost management. Because the system is idempotent, re-running the pipeline only processes newly appended logs. To achieve true idempotency while accommodating future formatting changes, the architecture separates the costly process of summarization from the deterministic process of rendering. Summaries generated by the language model are cached in machine-readable JSON files within a hidden directory structure (e.g., .summary\_data/). When formatting tweaks are required—such as altering spacing, modifying blockquote styles, or changing timestamp displays—the generation script reconstructs the Markdown files entirely from the cached .summary\_data/ JSON without initiating new, token-expensive requests to the language model. This paradigm mirrors static site generation and diverges from the active telemetry models of tools like AgentWatch, which relies on a live SQLite database and Server-Sent Events to stream local timelines10. By persisting the output as standard JSON and Markdown, the proposed system ensures that highly valuable summaries are resiliently archived in Git alongside the codebase, insulated from the lifecycle of any specific observability server.

## **Graphical Trace Visualization: The Perfetto Paradigm**

The core graphical interface of the proposed system is a multi-track Gantt chart, utilizing real time in the user's timezone on the X-axis, capable of supporting semantic zooming from macro-level project phases down to precise tool invocations. The proposal explicitly cites Perfetto as the inspirational model and structural foundation for this view.

### **The Perfetto Tracing Ecosystem**

Perfetto, originally developed for system-wide profiling in Android and Linux, has evolved into a premier trace analysis and visualization platform for highly complex, asynchronous software systems11. Its architecture is uniquely suited to the proposed coordinator/sub-agent DAG layout for several critical structural reasons.
First, Perfetto is capable of ingesting the Chromium Trace Event Format (JSON), which defines asynchronous events using specific phase markers. These markers dictate the start, end, and duration of arbitrary events13. Recent updates to Perfetto have explicitly addressed legacy issues with overlapping synchronous events, which previously caused rendering failures when parsing complex parallel workloads. Perfetto now ingests overlapping events onto overflow tracks and merges them back into a single thread track, making it highly robust for rendering the parallel lifespans of multiple sub-agents operating concurrently13.
Second, Perfetto separates the data layer from the presentation layer via its SQL-based Trace Processor. The Trace Processor ingests multi-gigabyte trace files and exposes a SQLite interface, allowing complex queries over the execution topology11. This backend empowers developers to execute SQL queries to compute the exact aggregate statistics requested in the proposal. Furthermore, the Perfetto community has recently developed Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, enabling autonomous agents to directly query PerfettoSQL traces for automated analysis of hotspots and timeline anomalies15. This creates a recursive capability where future agents could analyze the timeline generated by their predecessors.

### **Integration Mechanisms and Extensibility**

To serve the generated multi-track timeline, Perfetto's UI can be embedded directly into custom web applications. The platform supports instantiation via window.open() or \<iframe\> (where cross-origin policies permit), accepting trace data through the postMessage API18. This allows a host application—such as a lightweight local Python web server—to fetch the statically generated JSON trace files and pipe them directly into an embedded Perfetto viewer.
This embedding strategy preserves the powerful zooming, panning, and track-pinning capabilities of the native Perfetto UI while allowing the host application to surround it with custom HTML. By listening to selection events or extending Perfetto's plugin architecture, the host can trigger the opening of the proposed tabbed text modals. When a user clicks a specific sub-block, the interface retrieves the corresponding Markdown transcript segment from the local disk, rendering the "Agent Work Summary" alongside the full verbatim transcript.

### **Comparative Visualizers: LangGraph Studio, AgentWatch, and Polygentic**

While Perfetto offers a highly performant rendering engine tailored for time-series events, other tools in the AI ecosystem provide domain-specific visualizers that highlight the unique value proposition of the proposed system.

| Visualization Framework | Primary Paradigm | Timeline Rendering | Agent State Categorization | Trace Compression | Integration Method |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Proposed Architecture** | Hierarchical narrative \+ Chronological DAG | Multi-track Gantt, real-time X-axis | Colored blocks (Active, Waiting, Idle) | Generative multi-level semantic summarization | Embedded Perfetto web view reading Git files |
| **LangGraph Studio** \[cite: 19, 20\] | State machine execution topology | Graph node transitions, sequential replay | Node execution vs. Interruption/HITL | Raw state object persistence | Hosted desktop app / Web cloud |
| **AgentWatch** \[cite: 10\] | Local chronological ledger & terminal UI | Streamed event tail, basic token UI | Filterable by event type (thinking, tool I/O) | None (shows full raw payload) | Standalone localhost web server |
| **Polygentic** \[cite: 21\] | Workflow orchestration | Visual agent routing paths | Branch, Aggregate, Loop, Stack | None (focuses on live execution routing) | Cloud SaaS dashboard |
| **Arize Phoenix** \[cite: 7, 22\] | Telemetry & evaluation metric dashboard | Flat chronological trace view | Categorized by SpanKind (AGENT, TOOL) | None (shows full raw payload) | Standalone web server / Notebook |

LangGraph Studio is deeply integrated with the LangGraph state machine. It visualizes agents as directed graphs where nodes represent functions and edges define transitions19. It is uniquely powerful for its "time travel" feature, which allows developers to rewind execution to a previous checkpoint, modify the underlying state, and fork the thread9. However, LangGraph Studio's visualization is primarily topological and state-based rather than strictly chronological. It is optimized for debugging the internal logic of an application, not for providing a chronological narrative of a generic, framework-agnostic multi-agent run.
AgentWatch is a local-only observability tool designed to track multiple coding agents (such as Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor) running simultaneously on a single machine10. It provides a live chronological timeline, call graphs, and token charts. While AgentWatch successfully unifies the raw logs of diverse agents into a single view, it acts as a passive ledger. It does not actively summarize the data, abstract the events into semantic phases, or build the "phrase to paragraph" textual hierarchy envisioned in the proposal.
Polygentic offers a workflow editor and an execution flow visualizer designed to coordinate true multi-agent interactions through primitives like branching, aggregating, and looping21. While it visualizes execution paths, its focus is on building and orchestrating agents in a cloud environment rather than acting as a local, idempotent archiver of historical transcripts.
The proposed system occupies a unique intersection: utilizing a chronological, Perfetto-style timeline mapped to a causal DAG, but uniquely enriched with generative, multi-level textual abstraction that no purely metrics-driven platform currently provides.

## **Hierarchical Summarization: From Telemetry to Narrative**

The most defining feature of the proposed architecture is its reliance on text at multiple granularities. As the user zooms into the timeline, the interface transitions from reading overarching project phases to paragraph summaries, and finally to individual phrases and raw transcripts. This requirement aligns fundamentally with the theoretical framework of RAPTOR (Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval).

### **The RAPTOR Methodology**

Standard retrieval-augmented generation and conventional trace analysis methods typically chunk text and analyze it in isolation. This paradigm limits the holistic understanding of long document contexts or extended execution histories, as isolated chunks lose the causal thread of the overall workflow25. RAPTOR introduces a novel paradigm for constructing a multi-level summarization tree from the bottom up, establishing a hierarchy of information25.
The algorithm operates through a strict recursive methodology:

> 1. **Chunking and Embedding:** The base text (in this context, the raw agent transcript) is segmented into contiguous, logically coherent chunks. These chunks are embedded into a high-dimensional vector space26.
> 2. **Clustering:** A clustering algorithm groups semantically related chunks. While traditional RAPTOR clusters based on semantic similarity regardless of position, processing execution traces heavily weights temporal proximity, ensuring that chronologically contiguous actions are grouped into phases25.
> 3. **Summarization:** A language model processes each cluster to generate a consolidated, abstractive summary.
> 4. **Recursion:** The newly generated summaries are treated as the new base text, and the embedding, clustering, and summarization process is repeated. This recursively builds a hierarchical tree26.

Formally, the recursive merging function operates such that if the initial trace is partitioned into chronological blocks, each block is summarized at the base level. At each subsequent hierarchical level, a merging function combines adjacent or semantically linked summaries, propagating critical information upward while discarding granular noise. This ensures that a global summary accurately reflects local details without becoming overly verbose28.

### **Application to Temporal Rollups and Topological Edges**

In the proposed architecture, this recursive abstraction must be applied simultaneously across two dimensions: topological and temporal.
Topologically, the abstraction focuses on the "spawn edge." When a coordinator spawns a sub-agent, the sub-agent's entire execution lifecycle—which may contain hundreds of tool calls, internal reasoning steps, and bash executions—represents a massive block of low-level tokens. The summarization engine recursively abstracts this sub-agent's trace into a single paragraph. This paragraph annotates the spawn edge on the user interface, succinctly explaining the net outcome of that delegation to the coordinator.
Temporally, the abstraction governs the generation of daily and weekly progress reports. The proposal explicitly dictates that daily summaries are generated by reading the day's raw transcripts and commit descriptions. Weekly summaries are then generated by directly summarizing the daily summaries. This is a pure implementation of recursive abstraction. A weekly summary operates at a higher tier of the hierarchy, abstracting the daily summaries, which in turn abstract the raw transcripts. By traversing this tree, a user can start at a weekly marker on the zoomed-out calendar view, click to view the weekly progress report, drill down into a specific day, and ultimately arrive at the raw messages.
Furthermore, as the timeline is zoomed inward, single short phrases (e.g., "Work on test-infra", "Debug race X") must appear directly on the timeline blocks. This requires the summarization agent to perform extreme compression abstraction, generating a three-to-five word slug for each localized temporal cluster. This semantic labeling of phases prevents the cognitive overload of reading dense paragraphs when evaluating the timeline at a macro scale, providing a qualitative sense of the agent's focus at a glance.

## **Trajectory Compression and Coordination Noise Reduction**

A significant friction point identified in the multi-agent paradigm is the low signal-to-noise ratio inherent in autonomous systems. Coordinators like Codex or fbcode/orc generate vast quantities of coordination noise, trivial tool acknowledgments, and raw code dumps. The proposal mandates the intelligent filtering of this churn, classifying responses into specific buckets to curate a dense, highly readable transcript.

### **The Theory of Trajectory Compression**

The problem of trace noise is a recognized barrier in optimizing long-horizon agents. When traces become excessively long, language models suffer from "lost in the middle" phenomena, context limits are breached, and token costs become prohibitive29. Several academic frameworks have recently been proposed to handle execution trace compression without discarding causal evidence.
**TokenSqueeze** and similar methodologies tackle this by condensing reasoning paths while preserving logical performance. They utilize adaptive reasoning depth selection, discarding verbose intermediate outputs and retaining only the pivotal state changes that materially affect correctness31.
**STRACE (Structural Trajectory Analysis and Causal Extraction)** addresses long-horizon agent noise by mining failure patterns and performing causal localization over a textual dependency graph. STRACE traces dependencies backward to discard irrelevant steps and extract a compact causal slice, identifying the true root-cause module rather than superficial execution noise29.
**TRACE (Trajectory Risk-Aware Compression for Long-Horizon Agent Safety)** reframes this problem as evidence compression, utilizing a Compressor-Reader design. The Compressor encodes the full trajectory into a compact latent state, which the Reader then evaluates. This prevents the premature loss of dispersed cues that often occurs with naive sliding-window truncation32.

### **Executing Substantive Classification**

To fulfill the specific formatting requirements of the "Agent Work Summary" tab, the pipeline must deploy the summarization language model as an intelligent filter. The model must execute a classification rubric over the raw trace, sorting responses into four distinct buckets:

| Classification Bucket | Processing Logic | Markdown Output Format | Example Content |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Trivial / Transient** | Omit entirely from the semantic narrative (retained only in raw JSON for timeline rendering). | *None* | "Tool/code activity only", "Acknowledged coordinator restart." |
| **Short Summary** | Abstracted into a single sentence representing an incremental update or minor coordination step. | \> AI response: \[One sentence summary\] | "Dispatched both agents and waiting for results." |
| **Paragraph Summary** | Detailed summary of substantive progress, design decisions, or complex tool outcomes. | \> AI response: \[Paragraph length summary\] | "Analyzed the memory leak in the rendering thread; deployed a patch to handle orphaned pointers." |
| **Full Entry** | Preserved verbatim due to high strategic value, major milestones, or formatted structural reports. |  AI response (full msg): \[Verbatim text\] | "🏆 M9 ACHIEVED: Userspace Binary Under hermit \--strict \--verify\!", benchmark results, or CI overhauls. |

By employing a framework conceptually similar to STRACE, the summarizer evaluates the causal weight of an event. If an event directly alters the project state, dictates a pivot in the coordinator's strategy, or represents a major milestone, it is preserved verbatim or as a detailed paragraph. If an event is merely a transient verification step in an otherwise unbroken loop, it is heavily compressed or eliminated.
The formatting of these transcripts must adhere to strict visual guidelines to maximize density and readability. Extra newlines after timestamps and horizontal rules must be stripped. Furthermore, horizontal rules (----) should be reserved exclusively for demarcating temporal gaps greater than fifteen minutes between consecutive messages. This spatial formatting visually communicates the passage of time, intuitively separating tightly coupled conversation bursts from prolonged periods of independent agent labor.

## **Semantic Stability and Project Glossaries**

One of the most complex challenges in multi-agent tracing is maintaining terminology consistency. Language models possess a well-documented propensity to invent arbitrary terminology—such as "phase 2", "round 37", "wave 9", or "option B"—that holds local context within a specific sub-agent's session but remains entirely opaque to external observers or other agents. When generating multi-level summaries across divergent, parallel sub-agents, this semantic drift results in disjointed, incomprehensible rollups.

### **Cross-Edge Context Windows**

The proposed solution involves feeding the summarization agent a substantial window of context *prior* to the item being summarized, extending backward across the spawn edge into the coordinator's history.
This architectural choice is crucial and represents a departure from standard tracing frameworks where spans are processed in strict isolation. An language model analyzing a sub-agent's trace typically only sees the prompt that instantiated the sub-agent and the subsequent actions33. By artificially extending the context window backward through the DAG to encompass the human user's initial prompt and the coordinator's preceding dialogue, the summarizer is deeply grounded in the authoritative nomenclature. It forces the summarizer to map the sub-agent's newly invented, arbitrary terms back to the established vocabulary used by the human operator. If a sub-agent refers to fixing "option B," the cross-edge context allows the summarizer to correctly translate this in the final output to "resolving the demo5 linux-boot breakage."

### **Temporal Glossary Extraction**

To further enforce standard terminology across daily and weekly progress reports, a separate terminology scan is executed to generate a chronologically ordered project glossary. This process aligns with advanced entity-resolution and ontology-building techniques.
Before the main summarization pass occurs, a preliminary lightweight language model pass scans the raw transcripts specifically searching for proper nouns, system components, error codes, and recurring strategic concepts. It builds a key-value dictionary mapping variations to a standardized canonical term.
This glossary is then injected directly into the system prompt of the summarization agents. By providing the agents with an explicit, constrained vocabulary, the resulting daily and weekly summaries maintain perfect narrative continuity. The temporal structuring of the glossary—tracking exactly which week a term was introduced—prevents anachronistic term usage. An agent summarizing week one will not hallucinate terms that were not coined until week three, preserving the historical accuracy of the project's evolution.

## **Implementation Architecture: The Agent-Team-Timeline Pipeline**

Transitioning this theoretical design into a functional, deployable architecture requires linking the extraction of raw logs, the generation of standardized telemetry, the application of recursive summarization, and the configuration of the visual frontend into a seamless, automated pipeline.

### **Phase 1: Log Extraction and Normalization**

The pipeline initiates by parsing the unstructured text logs or proprietary outputs from the active coordinators (starting with Codex, progressing to Claude, fbcode/orc, and gas-town). These logs must be deterministically mapped into an OpenInference-compliant JSON structure. Every sub-agent instantiation becomes a parent span, while local execution within that sub-agent becomes child spans. Timestamps are strictly standardized to the user's requested timezone (EDT) to ensure chronological integrity when rendering the X-axis. Concurrently, a statistical extraction script parses the raw logs to generate the metadata JSON, counting the total words generated by the user versus the AI, calculating total token expenditure, and tracking database tasks.

### **Phase 2: Idempotent Summarization and Caching**

A processing script reads the normalized JSON trace and verifies which spans have already been summarized by checking the .summary\_data/ directory. For un-summarized spans, the script executes the text filtering rubric. It aggregates trivial spans (dropping them from the text narrative) and sends substantive spans to the language model for summarization. The model is prompted with the extracted chronological glossary and the trailing cross-edge context window. The model generates the phrase-level slug for the timeline block, the paragraph summary for the tooltip, and the bulleted entries for the Agent Work Summary. These results are cached purely as machine-readable JSON.

### **Phase 3: Markdown Generation and Report Authoring**

Operating entirely off the cached JSON summaries, a deterministic formatter constructs the final Markdown files. This phase requires zero language model inference, meaning formatting tweaks can be applied instantly and freely. The formatter builds the daily and weekly progress reports, adhering strictly to the plain-language, deliverables-focused writing style. It constructs the tabbed transcript files, applying the exact structural rules: removing superfluous newlines, injecting blockquotes for short summaries, rendering verbatim text in fenced code blocks, and inserting horizontal rules exclusively for gaps exceeding fifteen minutes.

### **Phase 4: Frontend Display and Trace Rendering**

Simultaneously, a Chromium Trace Event JSON file is generated. This file maps the timestamped spans to Perfetto track objects, injecting the generated phrase slugs as the name attribute of the Perfetto slices, and embedding the paragraph summaries into the args dictionary for tooltip rendering. A lightweight local Python web server hosts the interface. It utilizes the Perfetto UI via an embedded architecture, passing the generated Chromium JSON file via the postMessage API. Custom React components sit outside the Perfetto frame. When a user clicks a timeline block, these components fetch the corresponding Markdown transcript segment from the local disk, rendering the heavily filtered Agent Work Summary in the primary tab and the unredacted full transcript in the secondary tab.

## **Conclusion**

The proposition to build an idempotent, statically generated visualizer for multi-agent history represents a highly sophisticated evolution in artificial intelligence observability. Existing telemetry tools—rooted in the microservices paradigm—focus heavily on latency, token costs, and raw payload inspection. While excellent for debugging immediate runtime failures, they fail to provide a coherent, longitudinal narrative of an autonomous system's strategic progress.
By fusing the high-performance chronological rendering of Perfetto with the theoretical principles of Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval (RAPTOR) and trajectory compression methodologies, the proposed architecture shifts the paradigm from metric observability to semantic observability. The implementation of cross-edge context windows and chronological glossaries actively fights the semantic drift inherent in language model coordination. Furthermore, by strictly separating the expensive generative summarization process from deterministic Markdown formatting, the system guarantees cost-effective idempotency. Ultimately, this architecture transforms a chaotic, noisy stream of multi-agent tool invocations into a legible, hierarchical story of machine labor, drastically reducing the cognitive load required for human operators to oversee, evaluate, and direct advanced artificial intelligence teams.
