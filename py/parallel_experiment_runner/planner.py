"""Lower one calibrated round onto a ``safe_ci_dag_runner.DagConfig`` (pure) + classify outcomes.

This is where the runner "reuses safe-ci-dag-runner; does NOT write a sibling": each seed becomes
one :class:`safe_ci_dag_runner.Step`, and every per-worker HARD limit is lowered onto the exact
per-step control the executor already enforces —

* ``worker_limits.memory_bytes`` -> ``ResourceHint.hard_mem_max_bytes`` (inner ``memory.max``),
* ``worker_limits.cpu_cores``    -> ``ResourceHint.preferred_inner_jobs`` (inner ``cpu.max``, and
  the core-budget width unit),
* ``worker_limits.cpu_timeout_s``-> ``Step.cpu_timeout`` (cgroup ``cpu.stat`` CPU-second budget),
* ``worker_limits.wall_timeout_s``-> ``Step.timeout`` (load-tolerant wall backstop, DERIVED at
  ~3x the CPU budget when the spec leaves it unset; see ``WorkerLimits.resolved_wall_timeout_s``).

The fourth containment axis, ``worker_limits.pids_max`` (inner ``pids.max``, the fork-bomb
guard), is NOT a per-step serialized field: it is applied uniformly to every child cgroup by the
cgroup manager at runtime (``manager.set_worker_pids_max(...)``), which keeps it out of the
serialized DAG and profile schema.

``jobs_flag=""`` is set on every step so the executor never appends its own ``-j N`` to the
workload command — a seed sweep's command is a complete argv, not a build tool that takes a
parallelism flag. The CPU cap is applied independently of that flag, so the box still enforces it.
