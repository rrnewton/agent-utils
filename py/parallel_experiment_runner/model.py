"""Pure data vocabulary for parallel-experiment-runner.

A seed sweep is described once as an :class:`ExperimentSpec` (an argument-vector template
with a ``{seed}`` placeholder, per-worker hard limits, and a hit predicate) and driven over
a range of seeds. Everything here is immutable data + pure helpers with no I/O, so the
planning/calibration logic is trivially testable and the runner never hides a scheduling or
containment implementation of its own — it lowers each round onto a
:class:`safe_ci_dag_runner.DagConfig` and hands it to ``safe-ci-dag-runner``.

This is RESOURCE CONTAINMENT, not a security sandbox. The workers run our own code; the
only thing we don't trust about it is its RESOURCE USAGE — code that leaks memory, runs
forever, or fork-bombs. So the box has four enforced axes, each mapped to one named failure
mode, and NONE of them reach for seccomp or user-namespace isolation:

* ``cpu``    — "run forever": a CPU-SECOND budget (not wall), the load-immune guard.
* ``memory`` — "leak memory": an inner ``memory.max`` cap; a breach is a self-contained OOM-kill.
* ``pids``   — "fork bomb": an inner ``pids.max`` cap. A fork bomb exhausts PIDs, not CPU or
  memory, so neither of the two above can contain one — this is a distinct, required axis.
* ``wall``   — defence-in-depth backstop only, load-DEPENDENT; derived at ~3x the CPU budget
  when a spec leaves it unset (see :func:`WorkerLimits.resolved_wall_timeout_s`).

Design note (why these mirror the design doc): the hard requirements — the four-axis box
above with CPU-time (not wall) budgets, a DECLARED+ENFORCED concurrency width, an up-front
cost ESTIMATE plus a measured ACTUAL, and a clean kill that NAMES what breached and by how
much — each map to a field or type below. See
``ai_docs/2026-07-29-parallel-experiment-runner-design.md``.

    """Per-worker HARD resource envelope — enforced, not advisory.

    Each of these lowers onto one ``safe-ci-dag-runner`` per-step control so a single runaway
    seed is capped at its own characterized limit and cannot starve the host or its siblings:

    * ``cpu_cores`` -> the step's inner ``cpu.max`` cap (via ``preferred_inner_jobs``), so a
      worker cannot use more than N cores of quota.
    * ``memory_bytes`` -> the step's inner ``memory.max`` cap; a breach is an OOM-kill inside
      the worker's own child cgroup, leaving the run and host alive.
    * ``cpu_timeout_s`` -> the step's ``cpu_timeout`` (user+system CPU seconds, measured from
      the cgroup ``cpu.stat``). ``None`` means UNSET — the guard is disabled. This is
      DELIBERATE: a CPU budget must come from a real measured sample, never be derived from
      wall time. On an N-core host, N wall-seconds is up to N CPU-seconds, so a wall-derived
      CPU budget is ~1/N of what a worker needs and would FALSE-KILL healthy workers in a way
      indistinguishable from a flaky test. UNSET (honest, wall backstop still applies) beats a
      guessed, too-tight budget. This axis contains "run forever".
    * ``pids_max`` -> the step's inner ``pids.max`` cap (applied uniformly by the cgroup
      manager). This axis contains "fork bomb": a fork bomb exhausts PIDs, not CPU or memory,
      so neither ``cpu_timeout_s`` nor ``memory_bytes`` can stop one. Past the cap the kernel
      refuses further ``fork``/``clone`` (EAGAIN) — the worker is CONTAINED, not killed, and
      the CPU/wall guard reaps it. ``None`` means no PID cap.
    * ``wall_timeout_s`` -> the step's wall ``timeout``, a load-tolerant DEFENCE-IN-DEPTH hang
      backstop only. ``None`` means DERIVE it (see :meth:`resolved_wall_timeout_s`): ~3x the
      CPU-second budget when one is set, else :data:`DEFAULT_WALL_TIMEOUT_S`. The CPU-second
      budget, not this, is the authoritative guard.
    * ``disk_bytes`` -> the per-worker workspace/overlay budget used for the round's
      free-space reserve check (cgroup-v2 has no space controller; see the runner's disk
      handling).
