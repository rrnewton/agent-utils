"""Impure layer: cgroup bring-up, one boxed round, and the calibration-ramp orchestrator.

Containment is NOT reimplemented here — it is the exact two-level cgroup-v2 machinery from

scope/slice are named distinctly from a CI run's. That is the whole point: N concurrent seed VMs
run under the SAME boxing that CI steps do, with real per-worker ``memory.max`` / ``cpu.max`` /
CPU-second / wall caps and a clean ``cgroup.kill`` on breach.
