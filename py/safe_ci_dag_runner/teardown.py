    WHY THE SIGTERM PHASE EXISTS -- it is what makes a timeout ATTRIBUTABLE.

    A step that FAILS reports itself. A step KILLED by a timeout does not: the
    process dies mid-run, so its output must ALREADY have named what was in
    flight or that information does not exist afterwards. It cannot be recovered
    by parsing logs later, because there is no output to parse.

    Many inner runners handle SIGTERM by cancelling and naming the unit that was
    still executing; on SIGKILL they cannot, and the log simply stops. Measured
    both ways against one such runner, same timeout and same slow unit, with the
    signal as the only variable: under SIGKILL the in-flight unit was named zero
    times, and the log ended at the start-of-run banner; under SIGTERM the runner
    printed a cancellation line naming the exact unit id. So the identity was
    always available -- this function used to destroy it by going straight to
    SIGKILL. The fix is not more logging; it is giving existing logging a chance
    to run.

    THE HARD PHASE IS UNCHANGED AND STILL GUARANTEED. After the grace this does
    exactly what it always did -- ``cgroup.kill`` first, then ``killpg`` -- so a
    genuinely wedged tree still cannot occupy a runner. The grace only bounds how
    long we wait for a cooperative exit; a step that ignores SIGTERM is killed on
    schedule, and one that honours it is reaped sooner than before.

    When per-step containment is available, writing the step's child ``cgroup.kill``
    SIGKILLs the ENTIRE subtree atomically, including ``setsid`` / double-fork escapees a
    process-group kill misses (an escapee changes session/pgid but not cgroup membership).
    The ``killpg`` that follows is a belt-and-suspenders for the no-cgroup path and is
    harmless once the cgroup already cleared the group.

    ``process.pid`` is used as the pgid (valid because the caller started the step with
    ``start_new_session=True``); the guard refuses ``pgid <= 1`` and the runner's OWN
    process group so a reap can never signal the runner itself.

    When enabled containment cannot perform ``cgroup.kill``, a warning makes the degraded
    teardown visible before the process-group fallback runs.
