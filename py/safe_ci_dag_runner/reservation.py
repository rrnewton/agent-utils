"""Stateful CPU-core RESERVATION ledger — collision-free core allocation.

``pick_least_busy_free_cores`` (in :mod:`safe_ci_dag_runner.cgroup`) prevents a
single run from OVER-using cores: it samples ``/proc/stat`` and returns the K
least-busy of this process's allowed set. That heuristic cannot prevent
COLLISION — two benchmarks launched at the same instant sample the same idle
cores and both take them, so their tracer/tracee threads land on the same CPUs
and the "pinned" measurement is contaminated by an unrelated run. Sampling has
no memory of who already holds what.

This module adds the missing state: a durable, ``flock``-serialized ledger that
maps each reserved core to its holder. Every acquire runs under an exclusive
lock, so it observes every prior live reservation and picks from the FREE-and-
UNHELD set only. The caller NEVER picks a core itself.

Design invariants (each has a test in ``tests/test_reservation.py``):

  * DISJOINT under concurrency — two acquires that overlap in time get disjoint
    core sets. The exclusive ``flock`` is held across the whole
    sweep→pick→record critical section (including the ``/proc/stat`` sample), so
    a concurrent acquire blocks, then sees the first's cores as HELD and
    excludes them. Serializing acquires is the price of disjointness and is
    correct for benchmark setup (a handful of concurrent requests, not a hot
    path).
  * RELEASE on completion — :meth:`Reservation.release`, the
    :func:`reserve_cores` context manager (``finally``), and an ``atexit`` hook
    all free the cores. Normal exit and exceptions both release.
  * DEAD-HOLDER RECLAIM — a crashed holder cannot release. Every acquire first
    sweeps the ledger and drops records whose holder process is no longer live,
    so a leaked reservation is reclaimed by the next acquire instead of
    permanently subtracting cores (the same failure class as leaked cgroup
    scopes that held cores because systemd only reaps an EMPTY scope). Liveness
    is fingerprinted by (pid, /proc starttime) so a recycled PID is NOT mistaken
    for the original holder.
