"""Pluggable side-effect boundaries, so the tick engine core stays pure and testable.

The two things a tick does that touch the outside world — running a reminder's shell **gate** and
measuring a health check's **file age** — are expressed as small :class:`typing.Protocol` interfaces
here. The engine takes them as parameters; production uses the default implementations in
:mod:`tick_hub.probes`, and callers can pass deterministic fakes in tests.
