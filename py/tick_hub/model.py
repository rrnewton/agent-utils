"""Core vocabulary for tick-hub: the declarative reminder set a caller plugs in.

Pure data + pure helpers, no I/O. A caller describes their recurring
responsibilities as a :class:`TickConfig` — a set of :class:`Reminder` values
(each with a cadence, an optional shell :class:`Gate`, and an :class:`Emit`
template) plus a set of :class:`HealthCheck` freshness probes — then hands it to
the engine once per scheduled *tick*.

The engine stays free of caller-specific reminders, handlers, paths, and gates:
each of those lives here as data supplied by the caller.
