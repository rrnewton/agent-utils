"""The tick engine: turn (config + state + fired-state + now) into the emitted lines.

One call to :func:`run_tick` is one heartbeat. It:

1. evaluates every :class:`~tick_hub.model.HealthCheck` (a HEALTH line each),
2. emits the ops-state machine's own lines (summary NOTE, tick-frequency actualization, disabled
   NOTE) via :func:`~tick_hub.state.state_lines`,
3. when the hub is enabled, checks each DUE reminder whose ``requires_flags`` are all truthy: runs
   its optional gate, records that the check ran, and emits its ACTION/NOTE when the gate fires, and
4. appends a trailing NOTE with the count of instructions emitted.

The heavy lifting (running gate commands, measuring file ages) is delegated to the pluggable
:mod:`tick_hub.protocols` boundaries, so the ordering / gating / emission logic here is pure and
deterministic given ``now`` and the injected probes.
