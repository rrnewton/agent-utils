    **What changed and why.** This function used to say "the original Codex JSONL remains the
    authority for command stdout and patch bodies", and it meant it: it set ``input_text`` and
    ``output_text`` to ``None`` and nothing anywhere else kept them. 0 of the 30,921 tool calls in
    one archived team retained either field. That single line is why 3.59 GB of vendor JSONL under
    gitignored ``teams/*/source_snapshots/`` cannot be deleted -- not because the archive prefers
    the vendor format, but because for those two fields the vendor file is the only copy. The text
    now goes to :mod:`wrkviz.payloads` and the tool call keeps a digest and a byte
    count, so the model still does not carry the bulk and the archive no longer loses it.

    **The two redactions are deliberate and stay.** ``working_directory`` and any credential
    embedded in ``repository_url`` are removed rather than relocated, and
    ``test_ingest_never_persists_cwd_or_repository_credentials`` pins that. They are not the same
    kind of thing as the tool text: they are *policy* losses, taken knowingly, on content whose
    value to a timeline is near zero and whose cost when leaked is not. The losslessness audit
    knows about them by name for exactly that reason -- a declared redaction and a silent drop
    read identically in a diff, and only one of them is acceptable.

    A payload is emitted for an empty string too. ``""`` and ``None`` are different observations
    about a tool call -- "it produced nothing" and "we do not know what it produced" -- and this
    is the layer that used to conflate them.

    Three properties, and each one is load-bearing.

    **Union, not replacement.** This is the entire reason the promotion exists. Orc's ``task_notes``
    table is mutable upstream and rows are genuinely deleted from it: on the archive that prompted
    this, 74 of the 4,583 notes in one projection had no counterpart left in the live table, among
    them a "POST-LAND AUTHORITY DRIFT" report and the note recording that an owner authorized
    landing a pull request over stale dependency edges. Anything that recomputed this file from
    what is currently observable would delete them. So an observed set that has *lost* a note
    leaves the promoted record exactly where it is; nothing in this function can shrink the file.

    **First promotion wins, with exactly one exception.** A note already here keeps its stored
    body and its stored provenance even when today's projection presents it differently. That is
    the same freeze-first rule ``orc._advance_task_candidate`` applies to the projection itself,
    and applying it again here is what makes the file byte-stable: without it, one appended note
    would restamp the provenance of every other record with the new projection generation.

    The exception is ``upstream_present``, which latches from true to false and never back. It is
    not provenance about where the bytes came from; it is the archive's record of *when it became
    the last copy*, and freezing it at first promotion would have answered that question only for
    notes upstream had already deleted before this archive first ran -- the one part of the
    population that cannot grow. Orc refuses to reuse a note id below its frozen high-water mark,
    so a deleted note cannot come back and the latch cannot be wrong in the other direction. One
    such transition rewrites one line of the file, which is a real change and should be visible as
    one.

    **Divergence in the immutable core is a refusal, not a merge.** ``task_id``, ``content`` and
    ``created_at`` are the fields Orc never legitimately edits, and the snapshot layer already
    refuses when they change. If they differ here, the two sides disagree about what a note *is*,
    and picking either one silently would be choosing which copy of the historical record to
    believe on the operator's behalf. Enrichment -- title, owner, author -- is not in that set,
    because it demonstrably does change upstream and the frozen copy is deliberately the older

    ``teams/<slug>/raw/messages/<thread-id>.json`` was written by every ingest from this tool's
    first commit and read by nothing, ever. There is no reader in this package, in its tests, in
    the browser bundle, in the standalone ``timeline`` CLI, ``serve.py`` or ``run_stats.py``
    shipped into each archive, nor in any revision of any of those: the only path join naming that
    directory in the entire repository history was the writer. Each file was a pure per-thread
    partition of ``raw/team.json`` -- the same agent, turn, event, tool-call and edge records,
    re-serialized once per thread -- so it carried no information the archive does not still hold
    and can be recomputed from ``raw/team.json`` at any time. On the twelve-team archive that
    prompted this it was 675,371,783 bytes across 2,932 files -- 50.9% of everything under
    ``teams/`` that is not a gitignored source snapshot, so it roughly doubled the size of the
    version-controlled archive -- and every ingest rewrote all of it.

    **Why remove it rather than leave it.** An archive is meant to be version-controlled, and
    ``raw/messages/`` is not in the generated ``.gitignore``, so every one of those files is
    tracked. A tracked file the tool has stopped maintaining is worse than an absent one: it keeps
    being cloned, it keeps being diffed, and it reads as current when it is frozen. That is the
    same judgement ``render.prune_retired_query_artifacts`` already made for the retired generated
    ``query.py`` launcher, and this reuses its discipline rather than inventing a second one.

    **Why at ingest rather than at build.** ``raw/`` is the ingest namespace. The build sweepers --
    ``render._safe_presentation_file`` and ``multi_team._safe_generated_path`` -- cannot even name
    a path under ``raw/``; they raise, and a test pins that refusal precisely so a presentation bug
    can never delete ingest data. Retiring from build would mean punching a hole in the guard whose
    whole job is to protect this directory. Ingest already creates, writes and fsyncs it, so the
    retirement belongs exactly where the writer was. A separate ``gc`` command was the other
    option and was rejected: it is a second mechanism for something the repository already has an
    idiom for, and it reclaims nothing for an operator who never learns it exists.

    **Why this is safe for an old archive read by an old reader.** No reader ever existed, in any
    version, so there is no older reader to break; the content remains derivable from
    ``raw/team.json``, which is written and fsynced immediately before this runs and is never
    removed; and in a versioned archive the deleted bytes stay in history.

    **What the sweep deletes, stated exactly.** Regular files directly inside the directory whose
    names have the *shape* the writer used -- ``<archive-id>.json``, the same identifier grammar
    ``_validate_archive_id`` enforces on a thread id -- and nothing else. It deliberately does not
    narrow that to the thread ids of the team being ingested right now, which are in hand at the
    only call site. The old writer never deleted anything it had written, so a lineage re-ingested
    under a narrower ``--team`` selection or date window left projections behind for threads the
    current ``raw/team.json`` no longer mentions. Those orphans are the oldest and least
    recoverable bytes in the directory, an exact-name sweep would strand them permanently, and
    because they would then keep the directory non-empty forever it could never be removed either
    -- so the narrower rule fails at the one job this function has. The price is real and is not
    hidden: a file of your own directly inside this directory named ``<something>.json`` is swept
    with the rest. That is the bargain every other path under ``raw/`` already makes -- ``raw/`` is
    the ingest namespace, not a place to keep notes -- and it is the one respect in which this
    sweep is broader than ``render.prune_retired_query_artifacts``, which can afford byte equality
    because its retired artifact had exactly one possible content. A per-thread projection does
    not: its bytes depend on the thread, so there is no fixed content to compare against.

    A symlink, a subdirectory, a ``.gz`` sidecar and any name outside the grammar are left
    untouched, and any one of them left behind leaves the directory itself in place.

    The sweep needs no durability barrier of its own, unlike the writes around it: it is
    idempotent, so a crash that loses the unlinks costs one repeat on the next ingest.

    A team that cannot be loaded is skipped and reported rather than ending the extraction. Loading
    is per team and reads only ``teams/<slug>/``, so one team's torn or unreadable state says
    nothing about the others -- and the projection is a monotonic union seeded with everything
    already in ``occurrences.jsonl``, so a skipped team keeps contributing exactly what it
    contributed on its last good run. Raising instead, as this did, meant a single team caught
    between its source manifest and its normalized-generation marker withheld every *other* team's
    new prompts on every run until a human intervened. The returned report names the skipped teams
    and their causes; callers must consult :attr:`TranscriptExportReport.partial` and report it,
    because a partial projection that reads as complete is worse than the failure it replaced.

    All of them failing is still fatal: see :func:`export_transcripts` for why an archive nobody
    can read is the one state not to rewrite the corpus in.
