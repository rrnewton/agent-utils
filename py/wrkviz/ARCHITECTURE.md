# wrkviz Architecture

This document is the cost and compatibility contract for `wrkviz`. It must be updated
whenever a model prompt, model-visible input, generated output field, cache identity, or summary
selection rule changes.

## Durable project and export layout

A durable archive is a directory such as `~/agent_logs_archive/summary/<project>`. One archive may contain
multiple teams under `teams/<team-slug>/`; normalized data, expensive summary artifacts,
model-usage receipts, and deterministic presentation files can be version controlled. The vendor
source snapshots are not in the archive at all — they are ingest input, they are the bulk, and
they live in a separate store beside it; see "The source snapshots are not part of the artifact"
below. A typical archive combines the registered Codex, Claude, and Orc
coordinator sessions from all source hosts; team registration lives outside the package in the
archive project's `projects/<project>.json` configuration rather than in application code.

The durable archive and a website export are distinct concepts:

- The archive accumulates normalized team data and every validated expensive artifact.
- `extracted/transcripts/` is a provider-neutral, zero-model projection over every selected
  coordinator: `occurrences.jsonl` preserves physical provider/team occurrences, `prompts.jsonl`
  is the source-identical-deduplicated chronological prompt corpus, `messages.jsonl` adds
  mechanically turn-linked responses, and `system-inputs.jsonl` retains synthetic/scheduled inputs
  without mislabeling them as the owner's prompts. Its manifest binds every file digest and source
  generation.
- A slice export is a deterministic view over selected teams and a half-open UTC interval. It may
  contain only 2026-08-06 22:00 through 2026-08-07 07:00 EDT even though the archive retains more.
- Rebuilding an export never invokes a model. Missing summaries degrade to normalized transcript
  and statistics rather than causing unrelated cached summaries to be discarded.

That degradation is presentation-only. Missing phase, agent-lifetime, project-overview, or calendar
summary data receives an in-memory fallback labeled `Summary unavailable`, with an explicit false
availability flag in the website projection. Phase detail JSON still contains normalized transcript
and statistics, but the builder neither creates nor links summary Markdown for an unavailable
slot. It never writes a fallback under `summary_data/` or registers one as a model artifact.
Compatible phase/rollup artifacts and source-bounded lifetime artifacts take precedence. Project
overviews require their source-bound projection, and summaries whose ranges extend beyond a sliced
export are not reused. Thus patchy archives preserve verified paid work without leaking later
knowledge into an earlier slice. A later `summarize` run upgrades missing regions normally.

`build` retains its single-team archive behavior. `export` accepts repeated `--team` values and
composes those independently cached teams into one self-contained site. The compositor renders
each team without model calls, namespaces thread, phase, edge, glossary, artifact, evidence, and
detail identities by team, and aligns every track to one shared UTC interval. It merges team
project/host identity, events, statistics, rollups, summaries, and artifact catalogs while keeping
the team label on every filterable record. Repeating the same export is byte-idempotent; both
single-team and combined sites carry a strict managed-file inventory that removes only stale
presentation files. A narrower slice immediately removes details and prior shard generations that
could disclose work outside the requested range. Calendar rollups retain
the timezone in which each team's cached summary was generated; hourly keys are UTC-stable. The
export timezone controls date-bound parsing and the shared display axis, not cache reinterpretation.

The zero-token semantic-zoom projection derives hourly, daily, and weekly activity bins. Hourly
bins retain UTC-stable boundaries, while daily bins use local midnight and weekly bins use local
Monday midnight in the team's display timezone. Local calendar boundaries therefore carry their
real 23-, 24-, or 25-hour duration across daylight-saving changes. The first and last bins are
clipped to the observed archive range; time before capture began or after the latest captured
record is never presented as inactivity. Empty bins remain absent so true inactive gaps stay
visible.

Normalized providers do not expose equally precise timing. Codex and Claude commonly retain turn
and tool spans, while an Orc task note is only point evidence and its one-second normalized turn is
not a measured duration. Bins therefore retain the exact active/tool metrics for compatibility,
but the outer visualization uses separate, explicitly inferred fields. Each transcript entry
contributes the same centered five-minute evidence interval; their union determines activity
evidence opacity, and per-agent unions determine estimated average and peak worker presence. This
keeps the overview comparable across harnesses without presenting point surrogates as exact
wall-clock duty cycle. Tooltips label the values as estimates and expose the underlying evidence
count.

The browser chooses detail by time density, not by record count. At at most one minute per pixel,
the detail level renders phases, state strips, and applicable message edges. Above that and through
five minutes per pixel, the lifetime level suppresses phases/states and retains one block per
agent. Structural fork/join edges are shown there only for the selected agent family. Beyond five
minutes per pixel, the aggregate level
suppresses agents, phases, states, and edges entirely and renders one compact row per team from the
precomputed bins. It chooses the narrowest hourly/daily/weekly resolution whose nominal bin is at
least eight pixels wide. Coordinator and worker evidence is one downward-extending block: height is
**linear** in the number of agents present — six pixels per agent, counting the coordinator as the
fraction of the bin it has evidence for, so three concurrent agents draw three times the height of
one — opacity encodes activity-evidence coverage, and a distinct hue marks ranges with cached
summaries. Height is clamped at the row's capacity of nine agents, and a clamped block is drawn
with a saw-tooth top edge so a burst beyond the cap is not silently indistinguishable from one at
it; the true count is in the tooltip and the accessible name. Teams sort by descending recorded
event volume. Omitted zero-activity bins preserve gaps. These thresholds and suppressions are part
of the performance contract and are covered by browser tests.

### Static delivery and schema compatibility

Website builds keep every uncompressed identity file intact. They also create
byte-idempotent gzip-6 sidecars for browser-facing JSON, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and rendered
Markdown files of at least 1 KiB. The gzip header has no source filename and a zero timestamp, so a
content-identical rebuild does not change the sidecar or its mtime. Website exports inventory
their managed sidecars; ordinary obsolete sidecars are removed with the corresponding identity
files, while content-addressed timeline objects follow the retention rule below.
When a compressible identity changes, its old sidecar is removed before the identity is replaced,
so the server can fall back to the new uncompressed bytes rather than pair them with old compressed
bytes. All artifact catalogs, phase details, summaries, and their refreshed sidecars are complete
before a schema-2 bootstrap publishes objects that refer to them.

Schema 2 is the generation before it, no longer written by any build and still read by both
readers when an archive an older tool produced is opened. `data/timeline-v2.json` is its stable
bootstrap: it carries site/team identity, the complete time
range, aggregate activity bins, content-addressed global and phase-index references, and a UTC-day
detail catalog. The lightweight phase index supplies complete lifetime phase cards without their
state arrays. The immutable global object carries agent lifetimes, precomputed activity bounds,
structural spawn/continuation/result edges, rollups, glossary and summary-file metadata. Each
non-empty UTC-day object carries
intersecting phases (including their states), events, and detailed message edges. A phase or
detailed edge crossing midnight appears in both day objects; the browser deduplicates it by stable
ID. Object basenames are their complete SHA-256 digest, and their gzip sidecars are generated
before the bootstrap atomically publishes those URLs. Schema 1 remains the archive-local CLI
projection and the last fallback for older exports.
`data/timeline-v2/manifest.json` inventories the current and immediately preceding distinct object
generation. Identical rebuilds preserve that preceding generation without file churn; a later
changed generation collects objects retired for two generations. This bounded grace covers the
ordinary publication race without unbounded disk growth. Scope narrowing or a team-set change
disables the grace and purges dereferenced objects immediately so an export cannot retain data
outside its declared slice.

Builds project schema 1 into schema 3, the chunked seekable layout, and into nothing else.
`data/timeline-v3.json` is its bootstrap: identity, time range, team records, the codec
parameters, and a catalogue of every shard with its record count, byte counts, time bounds and
both digests. Aggregate activity bins are **not** inlined there — they are their own shard — and neither are the
transcript search prefilters, which is why the schema-3 bootstrap is 168,703 bytes where the
schema-2 bootstrap is 5,702,530. Shards
are multi-member gzip files of minified JSONL, one record per line, written and indexed by the
seekable JSONL codec: `data/timeline-v3/timeline/<team>/<UTC-day>.jsonl.gz` for events, phases and
message edges, `data/timeline-v3/spine/<team>.jsonl.gz` for the records with no single instant
(team, agents, phase cards, structural edges, rollups, projects, summary files, glossary, project
overview, and the derived zoom bounds), and `data/timeline-v3/bins.jsonl.gz` for activity bins
across all teams. Three further streams carry the transcript search corpus when a build has one:
`data/timeline-v3/search/<team>/<UTC-day>.jsonl.gz` for the records, one shard per team of
`data/timeline-v3/search-bloom/` for the trigram prefilter, and one per team of
`data/timeline-v3/search-links/` for the prompt/response relationships. On the measured archive
that corpus is 67.0 MiB in 192 files against schema 2's 509.1 MiB in 290, and a search reads
6.4 times fewer bytes for a byte-identical answer; `timeline_v3`'s module docstring records the
design, the rejected alternatives and every figure. Each shard has
a `.index.jsonl` sidecar giving per-member byte offsets, line ranges and time bounds, so a window
read costs the size of the answer; the spine additionally publishes each record kind's line range
in the bootstrap, because it has no time axis to seek on. A schema-3 shard exists **once** — there
is no uncompressed twin — and every line carries `record_kind` plus the sort instant `at_ms`,
which are the only two fields added to the schema-1 record. Records are filed by their own instant
rather than duplicated into every day they span; each shard entry publishes `t_end_exclusive`,
the smallest instant at which nothing in the shard is still live, so a reader rendering `[T0, T1)`
selects shards by `t0 < T1 and t_end_exclusive > T0`. Everything there is half-open, records
included: a phase and a bin reach to their own `end_ms`, and an event or edge reaches one
millisecond past the instant it occupies. Over the whole measured archive schema 3 is 38,288,394
bytes against 280,971,189 for schema 1 and 1,503,831,881 for schema 2, and adding one day rewrites
387,547 of those bytes.

**The generation that answers a transcript search is chosen separately from the generation that
draws the timeline, in both readers.** The three search streams arrived after the schema-3
timeline did, so an archive built between those two moments has a schema-3 timeline beside a
schema-2 corpus and nothing else — and both readers use it: `query.TimelineQuery._search_bootstrap`
opens `data/timeline-v2.json` for exactly that archive, and `static/app.js` does the same through
`app.searchCorpusMode`, which is `"schema3"`, `"schema2"` or `"none"` independently of
`app.schemaMode`. Both refuse rather than fall back when the two generations disagree about their
`source_digest`: that is two different builds, and answering phases out of one and messages out of
the other would place messages inside phases they never occurred in. The page says which of the
three happened in its meta line, because "this archive predates the schema-3 search corpus" is a
fact about the archive that only the page can see. The corpus is also all-or-nothing **per team**
and not only per stream in both readers — a build that died between two teams leaves all three
sections non-empty and one team's relationships missing, and a search over that team would then
render every linked reply as unlinked, which is an ordinary-looking answer rather than an error.

### Retiring a format generation, and `gc`

**A published build writes schema 3 and nothing else.** Both older generations are retired as
outputs, and they were retired one at a time because their readers retired them one at a time.
`./timeline` reaches `data/timeline.json` only when neither newer bootstrap is present, and the
website used to reach it only when its schema-2 load threw — so schema 1 went first, 280,971,189
bytes on the measured archive (246,973,399 plus a 33,997,790-byte twin). Schema 2 stayed for one
reason only: the website had no schema-3 mode, and retiring the only format the graphical surface
could open would have retired the surface. `static/app.js` now loads `data/timeline-v3.json` and
reads its shards one gzip member at a time over HTTP Range, so `timeline_shards.SCHEMA_2_IS_PUBLISHED`
is `False`, `write_timeline_shards` refuses to run, and both call sites are gone. That is a further
1,503,831,881 bytes across 661 files no longer written on every build, of which 509.1 MiB was a
second copy of the transcript search corpus schema 3 now carries. Schema 1 remains the
*intermediate* format the combined export merges: `multi_team` renders each team into a temporary
directory with `_published=False`, reads `data/timeline.json` back out of it, and publishes only
the merged schema 3.

Not writing a file and deleting it are separate decisions. A rebuild over an archive that already
has either older generation leaves both exactly where they are and records them in
`data/export.json` under `retired_files`; the presentation sweep, which otherwise reaps
`previous - current`, is told to skip them. That keeps an archive written by an older tool readable
by an older reader — including its own copy of `app.js`, which no tool release can update — and it
keeps 1.8 GB of irreversible unlink from happening as a side effect of a build run for another
reason. `render.retired_generation_files` is the seam, and it is named for two generations because
it now holds two.

The deletion is `wrkviz gc`, which defaults to a dry run and classifies every file
in the archive as live, reclaimable or held, with the reason printed per category even when the
category is empty. It is a third user of the archive's existing mark-and-sweep idiom rather than
a second idiom, and it inherits both of the existing users' refusals: nothing is reclaimed on the
strength of "the last build did not write it", only when a named superseding artifact is present
**and complete** — schema 3's completeness judged by the same five-clause rule the reader applies
— or when a manifest authoritative over a directory disowns the file. Three categories are
reclaimable on a rebuilt archive: the schema-1 monolith, the schema-2 presentation generation
(below), and schema-2 objects in neither `current_objects` nor `retained_objects`. The rest are
reported and never reclaimed: the transcript search corpus in archives whose schema 3 has none
(below), `retained_objects`
(the previous generation's, kept one generation so a reader holding the previous bootstrap can
still fetch what it names), shards under `data/timeline-v3/` the bootstrap does not name,
`teams/*/source_snapshots/` (vendor input, gated by `audit-losslessness --require-lossless`, and
empty on an archive `migrate-snapshots` has moved), and the trash itself.

`data/timeline-v2/` is 1,434.2 MiB on the measured archive, an order of magnitude more than
anything else `gc` can see, and it is **two things in one directory**: the presentation timeline
schema 3 replaced first, and the transcript search corpus — content-addressed day shards with
trigram blooms catalogued in the bootstrap's `search` section — which schema 3 replaced second,
with its own `search` streams. The two halves are indistinguishable on disk, sharing one
content-addressed directory, so only the catalogue can separate them; `schema-2-search-corpus`
does, and holds 509.1 MiB of the total for as long as it is that archive's only copy.

Whether it still is, is asked **per archive** rather than per release, exactly as the `app.js`
precondition is: a tool that can write the corpus does not put one into an archive built last
month, so `gc` looks for `search` shards in the schema-3 bootstrap sitting beside this schema 2.
Where it finds them, the corpus is a duplicate like the rest of the generation and is accounted
for by `superseded-schema-2`; where it does not, holding it is the same rule as everywhere else
here — reclaim what a named, present successor covers, and nothing else. One rebuild, which costs
no tokens, moves an archive from the second state to the first.

`superseded-schema-2` is the other half — 925.1 MiB — and it takes three preconditions the
monolith never needed. **Is it still produced**: a superseding artifact says the archive can be
*read* without the old generation, not that the old generation stopped being written, and
reclaiming output the next build rewrites is churn. That cannot be answered from the archive:
objects are content addressed and the bootstrap goes through `write_text_if_changed`, so a build
republishing an identical schema 2 moves no mtime — on the measured archive the newest schema-2
object was thirteen hours older than the schema-3 bootstrap while the same build's
`data/export.json` named all 661 schema-2 files as its own output. So it comes from the code,
`timeline_shards.SCHEMA_2_IS_PUBLISHED`, which `write_timeline_shards` enforces by refusing to run
while it is false: the difference between "no build did" and "no build can". It is now `False`,
so this precondition holds for every archive and the remaining two decide each case. **Is that schema 3 a
successor**: completeness is entirely intra-generation, so a schema 3 a whole build behind passes
all five clauses, and publication order is schema 2 then schema 3, which makes "new schema 2 beside
old, flawless schema 3" one interrupted build away — the `source_digest` comparison the reader
already refuses on in `_search_bootstrap` is made here eagerly, before the sweep, because the
reader only makes it after one. **Does this archive's browser know about schema 3**: `app.js` is
copied into an archive by the build that made it and `gc` does not rewrite it, so a pre-flip copy
would be left fetching a bootstrap this pass just moved, with the fallback moved too; the refusal
asks for the positive signal (the bundle names `data/timeline-v3.json`) and clears after one
rebuild, per archive rather than per release.

When all of them hold, the current/retained/orphan split is subsumed into the one reclaimable
category, because the grace period protects a browser holding the previous bootstrap and the
flip's own precondition is that no browser reads the format for its timeline. The reason string
carries the warning, because this removes the last fallback: the chain is schema 3, then schema 2,
then the monolith, and the monolith is reclaimable under conditions these already satisfy, so one
`--delete` can leave schema 3 alone at the bottom, where a generation the reader declines is an
unreadable archive rather than a slow one. Reversible from the trash, and recoverable by a rebuild
— but *where* that rebuild can run is computed rather than asserted, because an ingest archive
holds `teams/*/raw` and a combined export holds only `teams/<slug>/summaries/`, and an export is
the archive most likely to be collected. Saying "rebuild from `teams/*/raw`" to an operator who has
none would be a false promise at the one moment they are accepting an irreversible-after-`--empty-trash`
decision.

The schema-3 orphans are the one category that changed side. Absence from the catalogue does not
say whether a shard is a retired team's or a live team's — publication is shards, then bootstrap,
with no atomicity across the set, so a build that dies in between leaves the *previous* bootstrap
in place, self-consistent, with the new team's shards beside it unnamed. Sweeping there deletes
the better half of a rebuild and, in the same pass, declares the monolith superseded. So the
publisher owns the directory instead: `write_timeline_v3` removes everything under
`data/timeline-v3/` outside its own plan once its bootstrap is on disk, and the reader's fifth
clause declines a generation whose tree holds a shard-shaped file the catalogue omits. A non-empty
orphan set therefore has exactly one meaning — a build was interrupted — and the remedy is to run
one.

Both the dry run and the sweep take the archive writer lock, the dry run included, because the
report is the input to a human's decision and a listing computed beside a running build names
files the build is halfway through replacing. `--delete` moves files into
`.agent-team-timeline-trash/<generation>/files/`, mirroring their archive paths, and writes a
`receipt.json` naming every file, its category and the reason — written before the first move as
intent and rewritten afterwards with `complete: true`, so that a sweep which fails partway still
leaves a record of what may be in the trash; restoring is one `cp -a` from the
archive root. `--empty-trash` is a separate invocation and asking for both at once is refused,
because the first pass is reversible and the second is not. The trash directory is in the
archive's generated `.gitignore` before it can exist.

`inspect` no longer parses the monolith to print six integers: schema 3's catalogue publishes a
per-record-kind count for every shard, so the same six numbers come out of the bootstrap alone. Measured on the archive's data, 1,480.3 MiB resident and 2.447 s became 71.9 MiB and
0.011 s, with identical counts.

The zoom bounds — the smallest interval that contains an agent's, a phase's or a rollup's actual
work, which is what "zoom to agent lifetime" frames — are a spine record kind of their own, keyed
by the archive's stable reference. Schema 2 attaches them to 14,584 records; schema 3 publishes
the same numbers, from the same derivation, without putting a field on any record that came out of
the timeline. They cost 324,624 bytes, 0.85% of the generation. They are published rather than
recomputed on read because the recomputation scans every phase state run and every event and edge
instant belonging to the subject, which for a long-lived agent means its team's entire timeline
stream — the 93% of schema 3 that the read path otherwise never opens.

Schema 3 is the read path. Every archive-local CLI surface — `teams`, `agents`, `phases`,
`rollups`, `list`, `show`, `search`, `stats` — reads `data/timeline-v3.json` and the spine shards
it names when a **complete** schema-3 generation is present, and falls back to schema 2 and then
schema 1 when it is not. Complete means: the bootstrap is a regular file declaring schema 3; its
codec block names a container, timestamp key, record-kind key and index suffix this reader
implements; every shard it names resolves inside `data/timeline-v3/`, is a regular file of exactly
the published `c_bytes`, and has a sidecar beside it; and the set of teams with spine shards equals
the set of teams the bootstrap inlines. Those checks are one parse of the 168,703-byte bootstrap
and two `stat` calls per shard — 181 shards, so 362 calls, on the measured archive — so they run
before every query. The published `c_sha256`/`u_sha256` are **not**
verified on the read path — that would mean reading all 38 MB to answer a question that costs
300 KB — so a same-length substitution of a shard's contents is the documented limit, narrowed but
not closed by the sidecar agreement checks the reader makes when it opens a shard. Whether schema 3
and schema 2 describe the same source generation is checked where the two are used together:
transcript search reads its corpus from schema 2, and a `source_digest` mismatch is refused there
rather than at open, where it would cost the 5,702,530-byte schema-2 bootstrap that schema 3 exists
to stop reading.

Measured on the same archive, in bytes read from disk to answer one question including opening the
archive: `list agents --team <one>` costs 284,952 against schema 2's 25,692,901; `show` of one
reference 342,601 against 25,692,901; `stats --team <one>` 342,601 against 25,692,901; `stats`
over every team 2,483,652 against 25,745,677; `search --scope summaries` over every team 2,483,652
against 25,745,677. Opening the archive and asking nothing costs the bootstrap — 89,298 bytes
before the search streams and 168,703 after — against 25,692,901. Transcript search used to be the
exception, because its corpus was schema 2's; on an archive carrying the schema-3 corpus it reads
about 72 MB against schema 2's 464 MB for the same result page.

The browser does not infer complete statistics from a partially loaded set of days. It uses the
global aggregate only for an unfiltered full-range view, computes narrower totals only when every
overlapping day is resident, and otherwise marks event counts unavailable. Opening an agent
lifetime loads the phase index once rather than every intersecting day. Phase, agent, and rollup
zoom use precomputed exact activity bounds and do not first materialize a whole lifetime;
subsequent timeline views and modal opens reuse the same in-memory promises and objects.
Successful object requests remain cached for the page lifetime, while a rejected request is
evicted so a later user action can retry a transient server or network failure.

Both the installed `serve` command and generated `serve.py` use the same dependency-free handler.
It selects a `.gz` companion only when `Accept-Encoding` permits gzip, retains the original MIME
type, and emits `Vary: Accept-Encoding`, the selected representation's exact `Content-Length`, and
a strong SHA-256 ETag. Mutable generated names—including `manifest.json`, `index.html`, and the
schema-1 `data/timeline.json` monolith—use `public, no-cache`: browsers may store them but must
revalidate before reuse. Only a filename containing a complete 64-hex content digest receives a
one-year immutable policy; phase IDs are stable identities rather than content hashes and therefore
remain revalidated. The browser uses normal fetch caching, allowing a matching ETag to produce a
304 response. Each ETag is computed once per distinct version of a file, keyed by device, inode and
`mtime`, so a 304 costs a stat rather than a full re-read of the object it declines to send. The
handler also answers a single `Range` header with `206` and a `Content-Range`, advertising
`Accept-Ranges: bytes` on every response, which is what lets a reader fetch one gzip member of a
schema-3 shard at the offset its sidecar index published. Ranges and content coding are never
combined: a range always addresses the identity representation, because half a gzip stream is not
half a document. A multi-range request, or a range wider than 16 MiB, is answered with the whole
representation instead, which is always a legal answer. The built-in handler disables directory
listing so generated object and transcript filenames cannot be enumerated through the server.

**The browser probes schema 3 first, then schema 2, then schema 1**, and announces in the meta line
which generation it fell back from and why. Both directions of the mismatch are real: an archive
built before schema 3 ships a bundle that has never heard of it, and this bundle is opened against
archives nobody has rebuilt, because a build copies `app.js` into the archive it builds.

A schema-3 first paint fetches `data/timeline-v3.json` and then, in one parallel round, two
published *line ranges* out of each team's spine shard and the single bins shard. The spine lays
its kinds down in a declared order and the two the frame does not need are the two largest, so the
paint is `[0, l0(phase_card))` and `[l0(structural_edge), l0(activity_bounds))` — a page that never
opens an agent lifetime never inflates the cards, and one that never zooms never inflates the
bounds. Measured on the twelve-team archive through its own `serve.py`:

| | transferred | JSON parsed | requests |
|---|---|---|---|
| schema 2 | 4,502,381 | 16,060,900 | 2 |
| schema 3 | 2,155,957 | 16,135,089 | 34 |

**2.09× fewer bytes, the same parse, and twenty more round trips.** All three are the trade this
layout makes and none of them is hidden: the parse does not improve because both generations
materialise the same records to draw the same frame, and the requests are the cost of seeking —
one bootstrap, thirteen sidecars totalling 8,218 bytes, and twenty member reads, issued in
parallel. What moves is transfer, because a schema-3 shard is stored compressed with no plain twin
and is served as it is stored. The two deferred kinds cost 340,835 bytes (phase cards, on the first
lifetime open) and 78,228 (zoom bounds, on the first zoom) against schema 2's 826,578-byte,
9,632,001-parsed phase-index object and zoom bounds it had already paid for inline.

Every shard read is a `Range` request for exactly one gzip member, whose compressed offset, line
range and time bounds the `.index.jsonl` sidecar published. A member is itself a complete gzip
stream, so what arrives is never multi-member and `DecompressionStream("gzip")` inflates it
natively; the server does the seeking, which is what the format was chosen for. A dynamic
`serve.py` endpoint that returned decoded JSON was considered and refused, because it would stop
the archive being a directory of static files, would put a second implementation of the member
table into a file frozen into every archive at build time, and would send *more* bytes. The ETag of
the first range response is remembered and sent back as `If-Range` on every later one, so a rebuild
under an open page is refused rather than spliced. Nothing is believed before it is checked against
the bootstrap: the sidecar's digests, sizes and counts must equal the catalogue entry's, the member
table must be contiguous and cover them, each 206's total must equal the catalogue's `c_bytes`, and
each member must inflate to exactly its published length and line count.

Detail zoom loads only shards intersecting the visible range plus a one-hour-or-eight-percent
buffer, by the published `t0 < T1 and t_end_exclusive > T0` rule, and filters within the member
because a member is the smallest thing the format can seek to. Aggregate zoom uses the bins shard
without loading a detail day. Lifetime zoom uses the spine's agents and structural edges. The
spine's `phase_card` kind *is* schema 2's phase index — the same nine fields, no state arrays — so
opening an agent lifetime costs no fetch at all, where schema 2 fetched a separate object. Zoom
bounds are fetched per team on the first zoom, by line range, and looked up by the archive's stable
reference. A `Map<key, Promise>` retains each sidecar and each member, and a second visit to a
range never refetches or reinflates it.

Transcript search reads the three schema-3 search streams. The prefilter is its own per-team stream
rather than an inlined bootstrap field, and it is fetched **only when the query has a term a
trigram can be built from** — so a two-byte query reads no Bloom data at all, where schema 2 parsed
4,527,592 base64 characters out of the bootstrap and then skipped every filter. Selection happens
after the filters are in hand, so a shard the filter rules out is never fetched. The relationship
sidecar is one shard per team with a published line range per kind, so a response after midnight
still opens its previous-day prompt without reopening a pruned text shard. Exact search uses the
same portable ASCII-only case-folding contract the filter does; non-ASCII characters remain exact,
and a non-ASCII or shorter-than-three-byte term never rejects a shard. Normal typing is debounced,
fetches have bounded concurrency, and a request-generation guard prevents a stale search from
replacing newer results.

The schema-2 path is unchanged and still validates what it always did: each object's team, range,
record count, record identities, roles and known agents, with identity byte counts and a SHA-256
verified before JSON parsing.

This delivery layer is additive. Opening the archive through another static server still serves the
identity files correctly — schema 3 needs only `Range`, which every static server implements — and
older generated sites without sidecars or schema 2 remain valid. The schema-1 monolith and the
schema-2 generation remain readable where an older build left them, but neither is written.
Measurements and remaining work are recorded in `ai_docs/PAYLOAD_SCALING.md`.

### Read-only query boundary

The installed `wrkviz query` command and the archive-local `./timeline` Python
entrypoint read the deterministic presentation projection rather than model-cache internals. The
archive entrypoint is dependency-free, resolves its default archive from its own directory, and is
the single generated archive-local query launcher. Older archives may still contain the retired,
byte-identical `query.py` alias; readers remain compatible with it, while the next presentation
rebuild safely removes the manifest-owned alias and its narrowly named bytecode cache. The CLI's
only inputs are
`data/timeline.json`, the generation-matched schema-2 bootstrap and immutable objects, referenced
`data/details/*.json`, and referenced rollup Markdown beneath the selected archive root. Search
objects are accepted only when the bootstrap digest, team set, and time range match the loaded
timeline generation. Path resolution fails closed on absolute or escaping references. Querying has
no write path and can never invoke a model.

When schema 2 is present, the CLI reconstructs its small query projection from the bootstrap,
content-addressed global object, and phase index instead of parsing the schema-1 timeline monolith.
The global, phase-index, and search-day objects carry additive source-generation bindings; readers
accept older immutable objects that predate those fields but reject a present mismatch. Transcript
search validates and consumes one day object at a time, retaining actual matches rather than
materializing the full corpus. Compact per-day linkage sidecars supply candidate-proportional prompt
excerpts and response counts even when Bloom filtering skips the corresponding text day. Older
search-enabled archives without those sidecars retain a correct full-scan fallback. A bootstrap that
specifically predates the phase index falls back to schema 1; malformed or digest-mismatched
schema-2 data fails closed.

Availability fields are additive to timeline schema 1. Older projections without them are treated
as available; new projections mark sparse agent/phase records with `summary_available` and each
calendar audience with `technical_summary_available` or
`plain_language_summary_available`. `show` and summary search never open a Markdown path whose
audience is explicitly unavailable, while phase transcript queries remain independent of summary
availability.

The `prompts` and `messages` query actions are an independent read-only boundary over
`extracted/transcripts/`; they do not require `data/timeline.json`. The loader verifies the schema
and SHA-256 of all managed JSONL against `extracted/transcripts/manifest.json` before returning a
record. Prompt ordinals are 1-based inclusive chronological indexes for convenient slicing. Stable
`record_id` values are the durable identity because discovering older history can change ordinals.
Prompt queries default to `human`, defined only by `author_kind` values `owner_human` and
`other_human`; `bot` is `agent` or `system`, while `all` retains unresolved classifications. No
message-text heuristic participates in this boundary. Message queries apply the same prompt
selection before following `in_reply_to_prompt_id` links to responses.

The archive-local `stats` action joins that digest-verified transcript projection with the
presentation timeline through the same fail-closed readers. It has no cache, write, or model path.
It counts logical prompts by their durable human, bot/agent, or unattributed authorship label,
linked and unlinked response records, and only genuinely available summary text; sparse fallback
prose contributes availability slots but no summary words or bytes. It never guesses authorship
from message prose. Summary text is the lifetime paragraph, phase phrase plus paragraph, project
overview, or referenced rollup Markdown. Team and half-open time filtering use the normal query
rules. Whole-project overviews are excluded whenever a time bound is active because they have no
interval to overlap.

### Mechanical transcript extraction contract

`extract-transcripts` runs beneath the same archive writer lock as ingestion. It cannot reach a
summarizer backend and records zero model calls/tokens. Occurrence IDs bind team/fork namespace,
provider, thread, native source identity, source location, timestamp, and content digest; logical
IDs omit the team occurrence namespace so byte-identical declared fork history can be recognized
without being destructively content-deduplicated. Multiple text blocks from one provider message
are grouped only by their native record identity/source occurrence.

Each rerun takes a monotonic union with the prior validated generation. Records absent from the
new provider snapshot are carried forward, protecting the archive from upstream rotation or
history rewriting. A repeated native ID with different content receives a distinct occurrence
because content identity participates in the ID. Immutable occurrence fields may not change;
classifier fields and prompt ordinals are projections and may improve. Data files are written
first and the digest manifest last, so readers fail closed on an interrupted generation.
If the current provider snapshot refines the same byte-identical source occurrence from prompt to
system input (or another message class), that current classification supersedes the stale class
instead of retaining both projections. The exporter matches the full provider/source/content/event
identity without message class, verifies every other immutable field, and records the number of
such refinements. A record absent from the current snapshot is still carried forward unchanged.

Provider provenance is deliberately not reduced to `role=user`. Codex counts paired native
`event_msg/user_message` occurrences, not duplicated response-item context. Claude retains typed
and queued human-origin commands while classifying hooks, task notifications, compact summaries,
and recurring inputs as system input. Orc retains `user_source`-derived ingress and author class:
owner GChat is distinct from inter-Orc traffic, while Web/TUI submissions without an author ID
remain explicitly unknown rather than being asserted to be owner-authored. Orc also propagates a
later explicit `is_owner=true` observation backward to older GChat records carrying the same sender
identity; this is an identity join, not a prose heuristic.

Some legacy transports did not persist a sender at all. A registered team may therefore declare
strict `prompt_authorship_rules` matching its slug, ingress kind, optional half-open RFC3339
interval, and optional exact native message IDs. Rules can only refine `unknown` or
`external_or_unknown` source labels; they cannot overwrite intrinsic provider attribution.
Overlapping rules fail the extraction. The exporter preserves the source label, rule ID, and
human-written audit reason on each corrected record and persists the normalized rule set as
`extracted/transcripts/authorship-rules.json`. A direct later `extract-transcripts` reuses that
set; a subsequent registered-project ingest replaces it with the config's complete rule set.

A rule naming a team the archive holds no normalized data for does **not** fail the extraction. It
is set aside, listed in the report, in `manifest.json` as `dropped_prompt_authorship_rules`, and on
stderr, and it becomes live again with no operator action the moment that team ingests. A rule's
team slug is stamped from the enclosing team by the config parser rather than typed, so an unknown
team never means "typo" — it means a registered team whose first ingest has not yet succeeded, and
failing every other team's projection over that is the outage this projection exists to avoid. The
scope rules are applied against every team the projection *represents*, not only the teams read
this run: authorship is rebuilt from the source label on every occurrence on every run, so a rule
withdrawn while its team's records are still carried would silently revert audited corrections to
`unknown`.

### Registered project ingestion contract

`ingest-project --config FILE` is the durable orchestration boundary above the three provider
importers. Its JSON schema version is independent of provider source-manifest versions. Schema 1
requires a relative output path and an ordered, nonempty team registry. Top-level timezone,
project identity, execution hosts, and optional date/time window are inherited by each team unless
that team supplies an explicit replacement. Relative output and provider source paths resolve from
the config file's directory, making the command independent of the caller's working directory.

Every object is an exact schema: unknown and missing fields fail before provider ingestion begins.
The Codex source variant contains a sessions root, coordinator root UUID, and optional explicitly
ordered continuation UUIDs. The Claude variant contains its canonical coordinator JSONL. The Orc
variant contains its archived state root, coordinator session UUID, and optional ordered
continuations. An Orc continuation is either a whole-root UUID string or an exact
`{session_id,start_message_id}` object for a reused root whose earlier history is unrelated. Team
slugs are unique and provider-neutral; identity values pass through the same URL, hostname, and
IANA-timezone validators as individual ingest commands. Optional per-team prompt-authorship rules
are part of the exact versioned config and its receipt digest; they never inspect message text.

Configured teams run in file order through the existing provider snapshot transactions, and each
team is isolated from the others. A team that raises is recorded as a failure and the run continues
with the next team: the importers share no mutable state across teams, each writes only under
`teams/<slug>/` while holding the archive writer lock, and a failed ingest leaves that team's
previously normalized snapshot byte-identical. Transcript extraction then runs, because it is
defined over the archive's normalized teams rather than over this run's successes — a team that
failed today contributes exactly the records it contributed on its last good run, and the monotonic
union carries forward any occurrence whose source has since disappeared. Withholding the projection
because one lineage is unreadable would hide the *other* teams' new prompts to no purpose.
Extraction always selects every normalized archive team, even when `--team` limited this run's
provider refresh, because the monotonic prompt projection cannot omit previously exported teams.

Extraction is isolated per team by the same argument, one level down. A team whose durable snapshot
cannot be *read* — the classic case is a crash between the source-manifest write and the
normalized-generation marker, which leaves a team the generation validator correctly refuses — is
skipped and named, not raised. Its occurrences are carried forward by the monotonic union and its
authorship rules stay in force, so the projection still represents it; what is missing is anything
that happened to it since its last good run, and that is exactly what the report says. Extraction
therefore stops only when **no** team can be read, because a corpus rewritten entirely from carried
records gains nothing and would be written while the archive is in a state no reader can validate.

Skipping is reported at four places, because a partial projection that reads as complete is worse
than the hard failure it replaces: the stdout count says `across N teams (M further team(s) carried
forward unread)` rather than inflating `N`; each skipped team and each dropped rule gets its own
stderr line naming the slug and the cause; the run receipt carries `skipped_teams`,
`teams_skipped`, and `dropped_prompt_authorship_rules`; and `extracted/transcripts/manifest.json`
records the same, so whoever reads the archive months later — who was not watching the run — can
see it. The manifest's `teams` lists every team the projection represents, read or carried, which
is what keeps the next run's omission guard able to see a skipped team; `source_generations`
lists only the teams actually read, because a generation entry asserts a digest computed this run.
Both `extract-transcripts` and `ingest-project` exit 2 on a partial projection.

Partial outcomes are loud, structured, and non-zero. The mechanical receipt records `status`,
`teams_succeeded`, `teams_failed`, and a `failed_teams` array carrying each failed team's slug,
provider, exception type, and message — plus a traceback when the exception was not one of the
classified data/IO types, since a bare one-line message from an unclassified defect is
unactionable. Each failure is also printed to stderr, the summary line states how many teams
succeeded and how many failed, the run is recorded as `failed`, and the command exits 2. A rerun
resumes idempotently and, once the broken lineage is fixed, the projection picks its rows up. A
partial *projection* counts as a failure for the same reason: extraction runs over the whole
archive rather than this run's selection, so `failed_teams` being empty is no evidence at all that
the projection is whole, and an exit status derived from it alone would report the run as clean.
Whatever remains that no per-team isolation can prevent — a corrupt `occurrences.jsonl`, a
violated union invariant, a full disk mid-write — is recorded as `transcript_extraction_error`
rather than raised, so a partial run still reports which teams did succeed.

The command has no path to summary backends and records `model_calls: 0`, `model_tokens: 0`, and
`website_build_performed: false` in its mechanical receipt, together with the exact config-file
SHA-256. It does not call `build`; presentation regeneration remains an explicit, separately
auditable zero-token operation.

Canonical references are `team:<slug>`, `agent:<team>::<source-id>`,
`phase:<team>::<phase-id>`, `rollup:<team>::<kind>::<start-ms>`,
`message:<team>::<event-id>`, and `tool:<team>::<call-id>`. The query loader strips the
multi-team compositor's `<team>::` namespace from source and phase IDs before constructing those
references. Consequently, a reference remains stable when the same team moves between an
individual archive and a combined export. List projections expose references and concise metadata;
`show` resolves relationships, optional phase transcripts, and mechanical prompt/response links.
The phase-independent transcript index contains every nonempty normalized textual event, including
system and lifecycle records, plus condensed tool records without raw tool payloads. Inter-agent
instructions and final replies are classified directionally from explicit phase and route metadata;
same-thread prompt association uses provider turn identity and `(timestamp, source line, stable ID)`
ordering. Cross-rollout parent/child returns link only to a strictly earlier instruction because
equal timestamps have no causal ordering across files. Routed prompts and responses are attributed
to the child that received or produced the work, while ambiguous routes remain on their physical
event thread.
Search objects are split by team and UTC day, content-addressed, and bound to the timeline source
generation. Parent/child route semantics link receiver-side Codex `FINAL_ANSWER` deliveries back to
their child instruction even though the two records live on different rollout threads. Both the
browser and archive-local CLI use the same catalog Bloom algorithm only as a false-positive
prefilter, then apply the same ASCII-case-insensitive/non-ASCII-exact matching contract to full
record text. JSON responses use query schema version 1, JSONL emits one record per line, and
Markdown is presentation-only.

## The source snapshots are not part of the artifact

Every provider snapshots the vendor logs it is about to parse, and the copies are the largest
thing the tool touches: **995 files and 6,524,876,923 bytes of a 9,662,206,589-byte archive,
67.5%**, on the archive these numbers were measured against. Nothing that reads the archive reads
them — not a query, not a build, not the website — and the generated `.gitignore` has excluded
them since the tree existed, so the tool had already decided they were input rather than output
and had simply left them physically inside `--output`, where they were also reachable over HTTP.

They live outside it now, in a store defaulting to `<output>.sources/` with one slug-named
directory per team. The sibling is chosen for the migration rather than for taste: it is on the
same filesystem as the archive in every layout anyone has, so relocating an existing tree is
`os.replace` per team — atomic, instant, and impossible to half-finish inside one team — where a
state directory under `$XDG_STATE_HOME` would be same-filesystem only by luck and, in the unlucky
case, a 6.5 GB interruptible copy handed to an operator as a default.

`--snapshot-root DIR` on any ingest or refresh, or `"snapshot_root"` in a project config, chooses
another. The archive records the outcome in `snapshot-root.json` at its root rather than
re-deriving it, because a run that re-derived would guess today's default: an operator who passed
the flag once and forgot it next time would start a second store, and neither store is invalid on
its own, so nothing but the archive can report the mistake. Resolution is: the flag, else the
recorded pointer, else a populated `teams/<slug>/source_snapshots/`, else the default.

**A build never relocates anything.** An archive in the old layout keeps using it indefinitely,
with no flag; `migrate-snapshots` is the deliberate command, dry-run by default. It records the
new layout *before* the first byte moves, so a crash leaves a state resolution recognises by name
as an interrupted migration and refuses to build on, and re-running the command finishes it. The
other ordering would leave a crashed run looking like a team that had never been ingested, which
is the one misreading indistinguishable from a correct reading.

Re-running really does finish it, on both paths. The rename path is atomic per team, so a team is
either moved or not. The `--copy` path assembles each team under `<store>/.migrating/<team>` and
publishes it with a same-device rename, so an interrupted copy leaves scratch under a name no team
slug can take rather than a half tree at the team's own path — which is what previously wedged the
archive between two commands that pointed at each other, with the plausible way out being to
delete the only copy of the vendor logs.

Two resolution refusals exist because one archive has one layout and because the pointer is a
name-relative reference. `--snapshot-root` is refused whenever *any* team's snapshots are still
inside the archive, not merely this team's: accepting it for a new team split the archive across
two layouts and then recorded the new one archive-wide, after which every already-ingested team
refused. And a recorded store that is not on disk is not created from the pointer alone — if the
archive and its store were renamed together the sibling `<output>.sources` is adopted, because its
marker says which archive it belongs to; otherwise, when snapshots have been copied for this
archive before, the run stops instead of fabricating an empty store outside `--output` and failing
several layers later against a directory it had just made. Renaming the archive alone is fine: a
store marker naming a path where no archive is any more is a rename, not the two-archive collision
the marker was written to catch.

Three things still read the tree, which is why this is a relocation and not a deletion: the
append-only guards (Orc's opens the previous content-addressed database, verifies it against its
recorded digest, and recomputes logical state from it), the frozen task-note projections, and the
losslessness audit that gates any eventual deletion. `audit-losslessness` therefore resolves the
root the same way ingestion does; an audit that could only look inside the archive would report a
relocated archive as "already absent, nothing to compare", a green result meaning the opposite of
green.

`serve.py` refuses any request path with a `source_snapshots` component with a 404, at any depth.
For a migrated archive that changes nothing — the files are not under the served root — and it is
written for the archives that have not migrated, where the bytes are still physically inside the
served tree. It is a serving policy rather than a security boundary; the claim it makes is exactly
the one that was asked for.

## Codex snapshot and continuation contract

Codex ingestion snapshots the newline-complete prefix of every selected rollout before parsing.
The schema-1 source manifest records each copied path, byte length, line count, digest, and update
time. Reruns accept exact reuse, a byte-for-byte prefix extension, or a newly discovered descendant;
disappearance, truncation, prefix rewriting, source-identity changes, and unsafe/symlinked paths
fail before an existing snapshot is replaced. Parsing is restricted to the paths in that validated
manifest generation, so an orphan copy from an interrupted attempt is not adopted.

A logical coordinator history may cross process/session restarts, but this relationship is never
inferred from temporal proximity. The only authority is an ordered, repeatable
`--continuation-session <root-uuid>` argument. The first configured successor links to
`--root-session`; every later one links to the preceding configured successor. Each successor must
be a coordinator root, and thread identities may not occur in more than one configured lineage.

The first successful snapshot freezes each boundary in optional schema-1
`continuation_sessions` records: predecessor and successor IDs, both source paths, the exact final
predecessor source line and UTC timestamp before the successor start, the successor start, and the
millisecond gap. Later appends never move that boundary. A manifest without the optional field is a
fully compatible single-session archive. Once records exist, omitting continuation flags reuses
them; supplied flags must preserve the recorded ordered prefix and may only append successors.
Changing, removing, or reordering the chain requires another archive.

Canonical-lineage IDs and cache-visible inputs remain byte-for-byte unchanged. A continuation
lineage namespaces event, turn, tool, call, and fallback IDs with its root UUID and prefixes agent
paths beneath `/root/continuation-<root-uuid>`, preventing common per-session IDs and `/root` paths
from colliding. The successor coordinator keeps its own thread UUID and is parented to the preceding
root for navigation. The provider-neutral graph contains one `continuation` edge from the frozen
predecessor point to the successor start. It is structural in the site, but it is not a spawn and
the renderer does not invent a child-to-parent lifetime return or progress messages for the
successor coordinator.

## Tool payloads are stored, not deferred to the vendor logs

Until this contract existed, ingest deleted the two largest fields in the model. `_archive_team`
set `input_text` and `output_text` to `null` on every tool call before writing `raw/team.json`, and
said so: "the original Codex JSONL remains the authority for command stdout and patch bodies."
That was measurably true — 0 of the 30,921 tool calls in one archived team retained either field —
and it is the whole reason 3.59 GB of vendor JSONL under gitignored `teams/*/source_snapshots/`
could not be deleted.

The text now goes to `teams/<slug>/payloads/`, a provider-neutral content-addressed tree written by
every ingest for every provider:

- `payloads/<xx>.jsonl` — up to 256 shards named by the first byte of the digest. Each line is one
  canonical JSON object, `{"sha256":…,"text":…}`, sorted by digest within the shard. Because
  `sha256` sorts before `text` and a digest needs no JSON escaping, the digest of a record occupies
  a fixed byte range of its line; indexing a shard is a slice per line and parses no JSON. One new
  payload rewrites one shard, so a repeat ingest changes zero files.
- `payloads/manifest.json` — records, text bytes, and the content address of every shard.

`raw/team.json` keeps only a reference per field: `{"sha256", "byte_length"}`, emitted only when
set so every archive written before this stays byte-identical until its next ingest. The byte
length is load-bearing, not decoration: it is what lets a pruned archive still say exactly what it
no longer holds, instead of presenting as a tool call that produced nothing.

**The tree is gitignored, beside `source_snapshots/` and not under `raw/`.** That placement is what
makes storing this content safe at all. Command stdout and patch bodies carry file contents,
absolute paths under the operator's home directory, and whatever credentials leaked into a log
line; `test_ingest_never_persists_cwd_or_repository_credentials` pins the promise that tracked
files do not. The split keeps both properties: the model stays small and tracked, the bulk stays
large and ignored, and either can be pruned, permissioned, encrypted or moved to cold storage
without the other noticing. Materialization is explicit — `pipeline.rehydrate_tool_payloads`, never
`load_archived_team`, which would pay 290 MB on one measured team to serve callers that want the
graph.

Merging is a union keyed on the digest and can never shrink the tree, for the reason task-note
promotion cannot: this is the archive's copy. Content addressing makes "first wins" degenerate
rather than a policy, which is why a payload carries no provenance fields — a task note's identity
is a mutable upstream row id and its body can change beneath it, while a payload's identity *is*
its body. Two different payloads under one digest is a refusal.

A shard the manifest records and the tree no longer has is a prune, which is supported, so it is
dropped from the manifest and reported on the ingest receipt rather than refused: refusing would
have made the documented operation freeze the team on every subsequent ingest, including the one
re-observing the very bytes that had been removed. A shard that is *present* but no longer hashes
to its recorded digest is the state content addressing is not supposed to reach, so before its
recorded byte count is carried forward it is checked against the bytes, and a disagreement is
re-measured and reported — otherwise the merge rewrites the manifest over the loss and
`verify_payload_store` reports the tree clean afterwards. Untouched shards are still not re-hashed;
that whole-tree pass has a name and a caller of its own.

The tree is deliberately **not** bound into `raw/normalized-generation.json`. That marker exists to
catch a stale generation, and a payload cannot be stale: its name is its content, a reference
either resolves or does not, and the store never rewrites a record. What the tree can be is
incomplete — which is exactly the state prunability means, so binding it would make every prune a
refusal on the next build and a re-ingest that recreated the removed bytes. `payloads/manifest.json`
records each shard's content address, and `payloads.verify_payload_store` — run by the losslessness
audit, never on the read path — is what compares the tree against it and reports a pruned shard as
the absence it is.

### The losslessness gate

`wrkviz audit-losslessness` re-enumerates each team's vendor rows independently of the
reader and requires every one to fall under a rule in `losslessness._CODEX_RULES` that says what
became of it, then checks the rule's claim against `raw/team.json` and the payload tree. It takes
no lock, calls no model, and writes nothing.

Three outcomes, deliberately distinct:

- **unaccounted** — no rule matched. There is no catch-all rule, so a new Codex record type or a
  renamed payload type fails on the first audit after it appears rather than being silently absent
  from every archive built afterwards. Exit 1.
- **unverified** — a rule matched and its claim was false: no event at the line a rule says one
  exists at, a payload digest that does not resolve, or stored text that is not byte-identical to
  the text re-derived from the vendor row. Exit 1.
- **declared lossy** — a rule matched and its claim is that the content is *not* retained. Not a
  failure; the inventory. `--require-lossless` turns it into exit 1, and that is the flag an actual
  deletion should be gated on.

The corpus is defined by `raw/source-manifest.json`, not by what `rglob` finds. An audit whose
subject is whatever survived on disk cannot detect loss — deleting a rollout removes its rows from
the enumeration, so the report gets greener the more is removed, and an emptied `source_snapshots/`
reads as "0 rows in 0 files: vendor snapshots are redundant". Every recorded rollout is therefore
required to be present and to hash to its recorded digest, which also catches the truncation
`codex._complete_prefix` would otherwise absorb by silently dropping an incomplete tail.

A rule may not claim more than its check proves, so rules were split until each claim was exactly
checkable: `response_item/message` by role, `event_msg/item_completed` by item type. The check has
to be about content wherever the claim is: a rule verified only by "some record cites this line"
passes on an archive whose every message body has been blanked, so the rules that say a message is
carried verbatim compare the text and the encrypted content against the vendor row, and the one
that renders a goal into a line claims only that the objective survives inside it. Dispositions
distinguish `redacted` — content deliberately not persisted, naming the policy — from `partial` and
`dropped`, which are content the archive wanted and does not have. Bytes are attributed by whole
row, exact for `dropped` and an upper bound for `partial`, and the report says so.

**Coverage is Codex only.** Claude and Orc would each need their own row enumeration and rule
table; the audit reports them as uncovered by name rather than omitting them, and an archive
containing an uncovered team can be sound but never lossless.

## Orc snapshot transaction and compatibility contract

Orc ingestion has two identities for every source. The logical identity is its original
archive-relative path, such as `.orc/sessions/<session-id>/session.db` or `.tg/<name>.db`; this is
what discovery, ownership, and manifests use. The physical identity is an immutable,
content-addressed copy beneath `source_snapshots/.objects/<sha-prefix>/<sha>.db`. Frozen task-note
provenance is a separate canonical JSON object beneath
`source_snapshots/.projections/<sha-prefix>/<sha>.json`. Temporary SQLite backups and projection
files exist only beneath `source_snapshots/.staging/` and are never valid inputs by mere presence.

The transaction is deliberately ordered:

1. Discover one exact indexed session subtree. If no usable index exists, inspect only the
   explicitly selected root session; unrelated session-directory debris is never adopted.
2. Back up every live SQLite source into staging, run SQLite integrity/schema checks, validate all
   append-only and mutable-projection invariants, and re-read staged TaskGraph references to catch
   discovery/snapshot races.
3. Hard-link validated staged files into immutable content-addressed stores and fsync the files and
   containing directories. An orphan object from an interrupted attempt is harmless and reusable.
4. Normalize only that validated source set, then durably write the source manifest, artifact
   catalog, provider-neutral team data, and the raw source snapshot.
5. Write `raw/normalized-generation.json` last. It binds the canonical source-manifest digest,
   byte digest of `team.json`, artifact-catalog digest, task-note digest, normalizer schema, and
   semantic source digest. Readers reject a missing or stale marker, so a crash between earlier
   writes cannot expose a mixed generation. A marker written before task notes were a record
   family omits the task-note digest and is still accepted, so an existing archive keeps building
   until its next ingest.
6. Only after the marker is durable, garbage-collect unreferenced managed objects. A retry removes
   stale managed staging candidates and reconstructs or reuses the generation idempotently.

### Task notes are records, not only messages

A task note reaches the timeline twice, and the two copies answer different questions.

`raw/team.json` holds the *message* it renders into — an `external_message` or
`inter_agent_message` event whose text is `[<task-id> · <title>]\n\n<content>`, attributed to the
coordinator or to the synthetic owner thread, and dropped entirely when it falls outside the ingest
window. That is the reading copy.

`raw/task-notes.jsonl` holds the *record*: one canonical JSON object per line, keyed on
`(source_path, note_id)` and sorted by it, with the task id, title, content, creation instant,
server author and task owner as separate fields, plus the provenance of the freeze: the projection
policy, the content address of the projection generation the note was promoted from, and
`upstream_present`. Nothing filters it and nothing rewrites it.

The record file exists because Orc's `task_notes` table is mutable upstream and rows are really
deleted from it — in the archive that prompted this, one Orc team has 1,311 of 7,826 frozen notes
with no live counterpart and another has 75 of 5,079, so for those 1,386 notes the archive is the
only copy
anywhere. Until this file existed, that content was version-controlled only as the lossy message
rendering, because the frozen projection that held it lives under gitignored `source_snapshots/`.

`upstream_present` is the per-note answer to *which* ones those are, and it is the only field here
that cannot be recomputed later. The projection has always carried `missing_note_count` and
`missing_note_ids_sha256`, but a count and a digest do not name a note, and after
`source_snapshots/` is deleted — the whole reason for promoting these records — the comparison can
never be made again.

Promotion is a union and never a recomputation: a note already in the file keeps its stored body
and its stored provenance, an ingest that no longer observes it changes nothing, and only genuinely
new notes are appended. That is what makes it idempotent — a repeat ingest promotes zero notes and
writes zero bytes — and it is also why provenance is accurate: re-deriving it each run would
restamp every record with the current projection generation, churning tens of megabytes for one
appended note and asserting something false about the rest. The single exception is
`upstream_present`, which latches from true to false when upstream deletes a note, because freezing
it would answer the question correctly only for notes already deleted before this archive first
ran. Immutable-core divergence between the stored record and the current source is a refusal, not a
silent merge; enrichment divergence is not, because enrichment legitimately changes upstream and
the frozen copy is deliberately older.

`TeamData.task_notes` is the single model-level view. `load_archived_team` reattaches the records
after reading `team.json`, so no consumer of the model needs to know the storage is split; the
split exists only so the archive does not carry the same tens of megabytes twice.

Modern Orc databases retain a historical `content_blocks` prefix while new records first appear in
`messages`. Normalization is a stable block-ID union: existing content-block events keep their
canonical IDs, exact overlaps are deduplicated, and modern-only blocks extend the transcript. The
append guard and semantic source identity cover both tables. This is essential because either table
can otherwise change normalized text without changing the other table's digest.

### Accepting an in-place append-prefix rewrite

The append guard is byte-exact over 18 named `content_blocks` columns and 6 named `messages`
columns at or below the recorded watermark, so an upstream metadata backfill — a `token_count`
written into an already-captured row minutes after capture — refuses the whole lineage even though
no record was touched. `--accept-orc-prefix-rewrite` is the recorded way past exactly that, on
`ingest-orc`, `refresh-orc`, and on `ingest-project`. It is empty by default and changes nothing
about the default path.

**The unit of authorization is one session.** The flag is repeatable and takes a session id
(`TEAM:SESSION` on `ingest-project`, where the team is also ambiguous), and it is validated against
the discovered lineage before any database is copied. That granularity is the point rather than a
convenience: a lineage is a session tree, the guard runs once per session in it, and the guard
raises on the *first* mismatching source — so at the moment the operator decides, exactly one
session's diff has been printed. A run-level switch would therefore re-baseline sessions that are
structurally impossible to have inspected, which is the same failure the per-team scope on
`ingest-project` already exists to prevent, one level down. Two rewritten sessions cost two
refusals and two flags, each read before it is granted.

The guard's three checks are not equally overridable. `append history shrank` and `append prefix
lost rows` stay absolute, because both mean rows are gone or unaccounted for. Only the digest
comparison is overridable, and only for rows that were already there: if the diff finds a row
missing from or newly present inside the prefix, ingestion refuses with or without the flag, and so
does a digest that moved with no row to show for it.

Whenever the digests disagree — flag or no flag — both prefixes are streamed in key order and
compared with the digest's own type rules, and the refusal or the acceptance names the changed rows,
the changed columns, and, when the column holds JSON, the changed fields. The operator therefore
decides whether to override *after* seeing what the override would accept. Every part of that
evidence is bounded and every bound is reported as a flag rather than applied silently: at most 20
rows, character windows anchored on the differing region rather than truncated from the start, and
at most 8 JSON paths per column.

An accepted rewrite re-baselines the source's recorded state to the database as it now stands, and
changes nothing else. It is worth being exact about what "as it now stands" covers, because the
shape this exists for is a session that is *still running*: the observed backfill landed on the
watermark row about nine minutes after capture, and in those nine minutes more messages arrived. So
`append_count` and `append_max_id` move by exactly the rows that arrived, and `append_prefix_sha256`
becomes the digest of everything the source now holds — a third value, equal to neither digest in
the override record, which pairs the before and after taken at the *previous* watermark because
that is the span the guard compared and the operator was shown a diff of. Ownership, the source
manifest, and the `.projections` pointer carry through, and the new snapshot object is a full copy
of the current source, so no record is dropped. On a session that happens to be idle those two
numbers and the pairing coincide, but that is a property of the session, not a guarantee of the
override. The event is recorded as an `append_prefix_override` beside the source, with
`degraded: true` and the reason `append-prefix-rewritten-operator-accepted-rows-preserved`. That is
deliberately *not* the auxiliary reason `conversation-history-rewritten-stable-spawns-preserved`:
that one records something this code tolerated on its own authority about Orc's rewritable
conversation projection, this one records that a human overrode a refusal about the durable append
prefix, and the two frequently occur together on the same source. The record is sticky and counts
up, so an archive that was ever re-baselined says so afterwards, and the same evidence lands in the
run receipt under `ingest.orc_prefix_overrides`.

The pre-rewrite snapshot object survives the run that supersedes it. Accepting an override records
`superseded_snapshot_path` and `superseded_sha256` beside the source, and object GC retains
everything the manifest references, so the accepting run cannot collect the bytes it just made
unverifiable. That is why the bounded diff stays bounded: it is a summary of an event whose two
databases both remain on disk and can be compared at any fidelity afterwards, which is a better
guarantee than either a larger cap or a second frozen rendering spilled to a sidecar file.

Retention is one deep per source and is reclaimed only by the next *accepted* override on that same
source, which supersedes the pointer and lets GC take the older object. These are whole session
databases and an archive is not a backup system, so every reclamation is the direct consequence of
a second explicit operator decision rather than of a routine run. The pointer is retained but not
verified: unlike a semantic baseline or a task projection, nothing later reads it, so a
hand-deleted evidence object is tolerated instead of failing an unrelated future ingest. The
override record itself — both digests, the row count, the bounded rows — remains, and remains
validated, either way.

Because acceptance is irreversible in that narrow sense, the refusal states the price rather than
leaving it to the user guide: it names the object that acceptance supersedes, says how long that
copy is kept, and quotes the two caps that bound the diff kept in exchange — rows recorded out of
rows changed, and characters per column value.

Orc continuations are explicit-only and ordered. A whole-root successor freezes the predecessor's
last source record, the successor start, and their gap. A bounded successor additionally freezes a
source-native message ID and resolved row inside a reused root. Source discovery and normalization
apply that boundary before summary inputs are formed: inactive pre-boundary descendants and
unrelated task databases are excluded, retained agent lifetimes are clamped, and task notes shared
across roots are partitioned at the frozen boundaries. Source-manifest schema 5 records the table
each boundary ordinal indexes; schema 4 records bounded links; schemas 2 and 3 remain readable. The
Orc normalized-generation schema is versioned separately so a binary that changes these
normalization rules refuses stale generated data until a mechanical reingest repairs it.

A frozen boundary is a row ordinal, and an ordinal means nothing without the table it indexes. Orc
moved its transcript storage from `content_blocks` to an append-only `messages` table, the two
number their rows independently, and both tables coexist in a migrated database — so re-deriving
the table at read time from whichever storage layout the database currently presents answers a
different question than the one the ordinal was recorded against. That produced a refusal —
"boundary row disappeared" — against wholly intact data, because the recorded ordinal was a
`content_blocks` rowid far beyond the end of the `messages` table Orc had since added beside it. No
single global answer can be right either: one measured lineage has two links whose ordinals resolve
in *different* tables, so whichever table one answer picks, the other link fails.

Schema 5 therefore records `predecessor_source_table` with the ordinal, and each source records
`provider_schema_version` — Orc's own in-band `schema_version`, which no SQL in this module used to
read, and whose absence is why storage-layout questions were being answered by guessing from which
tables happen to exist. A link frozen before schema 5 names no table and is migrated by evidence
rather than by layout: the ordinal is tried in every candidate table the database has, and only a
table whose row carries exactly the recorded timestamp can win. Exactly one winner is adopted and
written back, so the next run is unambiguous. No winner is a real refusal. More than one winner
confirms the boundary — both readings assert the same thing — but leaves the table unrecorded,
because a guess written into the manifest would be indistinguishable from an observation.

Schema-v2 manifests and task projections are exact schemas: unknown and missing keys, malformed
digests, noncanonical projection JSON, duplicate note IDs, unsafe relative paths, symlinked path
components, and content-address/path mismatches fail closed. This applies to both live `.orc`/`.tg`
paths and archive-local object/projection paths.

TaskGraph discovery follows provider semantics rather than filename scans. A provider-initial
session (`parent_id` absent) uses its nonempty `db_name` as the primary task database, falling back
to its session UUID. Every delegated session uses its UUID even if it inherited a `db_name`.
`associated_dbs` contributes an additional union of references. A never-observed reference whose
file does not yet exist is lazy and omitted. A previously snapshotted file that remains referenced
but disappears is corruption; a source that is deliberately dereferenced is retained as an
immutable `detached` source so old history does not vanish. A later replacement receives a stable
per-owner source ordinal: ordinal zero preserves historical event IDs, while later sources use an
`-sN-` namespace. Shared-source ownership is sticky after first observation; initial ranking favors
the effective primary reference, then the provider-initial session, shallower lineage, earlier
creation time, and stable session ID.

Semantic cache identity is recomputable from the current validated generation, not a hash chain.
For sessions it includes immutable session lineage/name semantics, authoritative content-block
history, and stable AgentBlock spawn facts. `updated_at`, `db_name`, and associated-database
references are discovery/provenance and do not invalidate summaries. Conversation-state rewrites
are accepted only when every prior stable spawn fact remains an unchanged subset; other auxiliary
message churn is recorded as degraded rewrite provenance without changing normalized semantics.
Session names remain semantic because they are user-visible labels.

Each normalized source records a canonical semantic digest independently from its raw storage
prefix. `semantic_sha256` may temporarily preserve an older paid-cache key only when an exact
content-addressed `semantic_alias_baseline_path` authenticates that key and the baseline's canonical
semantics equal the current canonical digest. Task sources do not use semantic aliases. This lets
storage-only materialization and ignored provider noise reuse valid summaries without permitting a
forged or stale cache key to survive a semantic change.

For tasks, a cumulative content-addressed projection freezes `(id, task_id, content, created_at)`
plus the first observed server author, task owner, and title. TaskGraph can hard-delete a task and
cascade-delete notes, so absence from a later live database becomes a retained tombstone rather
than history loss. Overlapping immutable fields must remain exact; a new ID must exceed both the
frozen maximum and the prior SQLite allocation sequence, including trailing deleted-ID gaps.
SQLite sequence regression or ID reuse fails closed. Presence/missing hashes and rewrite metadata
audit the live observation separately from cumulative semantic identity.
Mutable enrichment drift does not silently rewrite old events or invalidate summary caches. A
non-null server author is external/server-authored provenance: it becomes an `external_message` on
the coordinator, is counted separately from user prompts, and creates no agent or message edge. A
local note with no owner is retained under a synthetic `Unattributed Task Work` child rather than
being dropped.

Legacy schema-v1 sources keep their exact historical raw-byte source-digest shape and validate the
preserved semantic-baseline object. An unchanged migration remains in `legacy-raw-v1` mode, keeping
existing summary keys byte-for-byte stable. The first real semantic change transitions that source
to deterministic `normalized-v2`; a mixed archive is supported. Normalized agent lifetimes never
use mutable session `updated_at`: they end at attributed events/tools/turns/spawns, and descendant
ends propagate recursively so every parent contains all recorded child activity.

## Cost boundary

Fetching, SQLite snapshotting, normalization, artifact extraction, terminology candidate scanning,
phase construction, statistics, Markdown/JSON generation, and site rendering are deterministic
compute. They may be rerun freely.

Six model-computation contracts are registered: five active and one retained as
`historical-disabled` so old receipts remain interpretable. Their authoritative registry is
[`summary_registry.py`](summary_registry.py). Prompt version, output schema version, known version
history, inputs, outputs, and supported granularities live there. Prompt builders import those
versions; a prompt constant must not be invented elsewhere.

| Registered summarizer | Version | Lifecycle | Unit | Prompt generator |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `phase-work-summary` | 2 | active | one agent phase | `summarize.py:build_summary_prompt` (`phase` branch) |
| `agent-lifetime` | 2 | active | one agent lifetime | `naming.py:build_agent_name_prompt` |
| `project-overview` | 2 | active | one project/team knowledge epoch | `summarize.py:build_summary_prompt` (`project-overview`) |
| `glossary-definition` | 2 | historical-disabled | one mechanical candidate | retained only to interpret old artifacts |
| `technical-rollup` | 3 | active | hour, day, week, month, or quarter | `summarize.py:build_summary_prompt` (`technical-rollup`) |
| `plain-language-rollup` | 4 | active | hour, day, week, month, or quarter | `summarize.py:build_summary_prompt` (`plain-language-rollup`) |

Hourly rollups use UTC-stable keys and local-time labels, including distinct keys for a repeated
daylight-saving hour. Summary selection can request only hourly work or combine it with higher
calendar levels.

### Phase work summary

Staged by `pipeline.py:_phase_jobs` after `phases.py:build_phases`.

Inputs:

- A fixed UTC phase (30 minutes by default) of one agent's messages and one-line tool aggregates,
  capped at 30,000 characters by retaining the front and back.
- Up to 16,000 characters immediately before the phase from that agent and every recorded
  ancestor, including the coordinator. This is a character budget, not currently a word budget.
- Supported semantic concepts available before the phase ends (empty until the bounded semantic
  discovery pipeline is implemented).
- User-prompt, response, inter-agent-message, and tool-call counts.

Outputs are an at-most-80-character phrase, hover paragraph, and timestamped substantive work
bullets. Current projections are `summary_data/phases/<phase-id>.json`; immutable cache records are
`summary_data/cache/<input-hash>.json`.

Work-bullet timestamps belong to the phase's half-open `[start_ms, end_ms)` interval. There is one
narrow response-recovery rule for this contract: after every other response field and bullet
shape/type has validated, bullets outside that interval are dropped rather than clamped or moved.
If any valid bullets remain, phrase and paragraph are deterministically derived only from their
texts; if none remain, the existing transcript-only heuristic supplies all three resolutions and
never reads `prior_context`. A genuinely empty model list is distinct and retains the model's
phrase and paragraph. The exception does not apply to rollups or any other malformed output, which
still fails the batch. Because this is deterministic validation of the same response contract, it
does not change prompt version or cache identity.

Important correction to earlier design recollections: phase jobs currently receive ancestor raw
transcript context and the glossary. They do **not** receive arrays of prior daily and weekly
summaries. Prior calendar summaries are inputs to calendar rollups only.

### Agent lifetime name and summary

Staged by `pipeline.py:_agent_name_jobs` only after phase summaries exist.

Inputs are the official path, coordinator nickname, role, depth, parent path, the first selected
phase's ancestor context, and all available phase-summary phrase/paragraph/bullets for the agent.
Outputs are a hindsight short name, naming rationale, and one-to-three-sentence lifetime summary.
The independent cache is `summary_data/name_cache/<input-hash>.json`; projections are
`summary_data/agents/<thread-id>.json`.

The structured-output schema asks providers for `Coordinator` or a two-to-five-word display name
with no slash or underscore. The job-aware validator remains authoritative. If a provider still
returns a path or underscore slug, one narrow presentation-only recovery takes its final semantic
component, replaces underscore separators with spaces, and revalidates the normal word-count,
length, `/root`, and path/slug rules. It does not invent or truncate words; a leaf that cannot pass
the original display-name contract still fails closed. A repaired batch retains every validated
name, rationale, and lifetime summary and records the exact raw response and replacement in the
receipt-linked backend-output audit. This deterministic enforcement of the existing output
contract does not invalidate older valid name caches.

### Project overview

Staged by `pipeline.py:_project_overview_job`.

The input is at most 48,000 characters from early root user/assistant conversation before a frozen
knowledge cutoff. Source event IDs, bounds, and a context digest are retained. The output is either
an evidence-supported newcomer overview or an explicit `Insufficient evidence` result. It may not
emit links. The projection is `summary_data/project_overview.json`. Ordinary later append-only
growth reuses the frozen evidence epoch. If a later importer discovers additional early events or
corrects a provider-system envelope that was formerly classified as an owner prompt, the pipeline
first reconstructs every recorded event by ID and proves its text, timestamp, and aggregate digest
are unchanged. Only then does it create a deterministic replacement knowledge epoch; both the old
and new content-addressed artifacts remain in the catalog. Removal, truncation, or mutation of any
recorded event still fails closed.

### Glossary definition

The definition-only contract is disabled: it established whether a mechanically selected string
could be explained, not whether the string belonged in a durable project ontology. New summarize
runs neither inject candidate strings into prompts nor launch definition jobs. Historical schema-3
projections, cache artifacts, and receipts stay untouched for provenance; builds ignore them and
publish an empty glossary until a bounded semantic discovery pipeline is implemented.

### Technical calendar rollup

Staged by `pipeline.py:_rollup_jobs_for_level` in chronological order for selected hourly, daily,
weekly, monthly, and quarterly levels.

Inputs are fully contained lower-level summaries, uncovered phase summaries at calendar
boundaries, up to ten already-completed earlier summaries of the same level, supported semantic
concepts (currently empty), and aggregate statistics. Thus a weekly job consumes daily summaries plus up to ten prior
weekly summaries; it does not directly receive an arbitrary independent array of ten prior days and
ten prior weeks. An hourly job consumes phases. A daily job consumes hourly summaries when that
level was requested in the same run, otherwise phases, plus up to ten prior daily summaries.

Outputs use the common phrase/paragraph/work-bullet schema and are projected under
`summary_data/rollups/<kind>/<key>.json`.

### Plain-language calendar rollup

This is a separate paid rewrite, not deterministic formatting. It receives the same-period
technical result as its authoritative factual account, plus analogous lower-level and up-to-ten
prior same-level plain-language results, the project overview, and supported chronological glossary
definitions. The plain result must preserve the technical result's completion state, outcomes,
counts, and time scope: for example, it cannot turn validated or approved work into landed work or
attribute an earlier backlog reduction to the current period. It identifies the project for a
newcomer and describes content before opaque work-management identifiers. It shares each rollup
projection with the technical result but has an independent input hash and usage receipt, with the
technical artifact recorded as a provenance dependency.

## Common cache identity and receipts

Both runners content-address a job over the exact structured model payload plus registered
summarizer ID/version, output schema version, backend, model, prompt version, reasoning effort, and
non-default service tier. The default tier is omitted from the hash for compatibility with caches
predating explicit tier support. Batch size and worker count do not affect artifact identity.

Validated batches are published immediately in the shared version-1 envelope defined by
`summary_artifacts.py`. Every artifact records its deterministic artifact ID, logical key, team and
time interval, complete summarizer contract, model selection, context coverage, dependency keys,
generation time, and generating usage receipt. Every attempted backend batch has an immutable
usage receipt under the relevant cache's `_usage/` tree. The envelope version describes storage
shape and is distinct from the registered summarizer and output-schema versions.

The Codex runner uses an ephemeral read-only workspace. The Claude runner uses `claude --print`
with safe mode, no session persistence, no tools, `dontAsk` permissions, and an inline JSON schema.
It accepts only the CLI's `structured_output` object and requires the native usage object on every
successful call; there is no plain-result, model, or backend fallback. Claude's normalized input
counter is direct input plus cache-creation input plus cache-read input, with both cache categories
also retained separately. Both runners feed the same strict summary/naming parsers and immutable
receipt/cache lifecycle.

When a backend's final message fails validation, or a bounded phase/name rule repairs it, the exact
raw final message is preserved at `_usage/backend_outputs/<receipt-id>.json`. Every audit record
includes a SHA-256 content hash. A phase audit also records each job's half-open bounds plus the
index, timestamp, and `dropped-out-of-range` action for repaired bullets; a naming audit records the
job key, response index, rejected path/slug, and validated display-name replacement. Audit records
deliberately exclude the model prompt and captured Codex CLI stdout/stderr. For a nonzero backend
exit, the durable failure receipt and propagated exception retain the exit code but no captured
stream detail. Ordinary valid responses need no duplicate raw-output record.

The resolvers also try the former hash scheme. Valid summary-cache v1/v2 and naming-cache v3 files
remain hits without token spend; they receive in-memory provenance marked `legacy_storage: true`
and `unknown-legacy` context coverage. They are never rewritten merely to migrate storage.
Pre-lifetime naming-cache v2 remains incompatible because it lacks the required lifetime summary.
Compatibility rule: an older paid cache whose final bullet is exactly `end_ms` remains readable as
a cache hit and byte-for-byte unchanged. Only newly validated backend output and newly generated
deterministic fallback use half-open bounds.

Projection records now carry the common provenance when it is known, while readers continue to
accept pre-envelope projections. `summary_data/artifacts.json` retains every observed artifact
reference across runs and reports counts by summarizer version, output schema, model, and frontier
status. Its selection API prefers the strongest registered compatible version and context score,
with an optional explicit model preference.

## Standard staged-computation contract

Every registered summarizer will use the following common lifecycle:

1. **Stage input.** Materialize a deterministic job with logical key, team, half-open interval,
   registered summarizer ID/version, exact model-visible payload, dependency artifact IDs, and
   context-availability metadata.
2. **Hash.** Hash the canonical prompt contract, exact payload, backend/model/effort/tier, and
   output schema. Derived diagnostic metadata that is not model-visible is recorded but does not
   masquerade as a prompt input.
3. **Resolve.** Select an exact cache hit or submit a bounded batch. Validate every response against
   that registered output schema before publication. The phase-only timestamp recovery above is
   the sole deterministic exception; it never broadens schema/type validation.
4. **Publish immutable artifact.** Store the result, full version identity, dependency identities,
   context coverage, chronological frontier status, generation time, and usage-receipt ID. Never
   overwrite an artifact at a different content hash.
5. **Project.** Update a cheap logical-key index pointing to available artifacts. A projection may
   mix versions across time.
6. **Render.** Select the newest compatible artifact available for each logical key. Missing newer
   fields are absent/unknown in the UI, not fabricated and not a build failure.

Steps 1 through 5 use the shared runner contract for all six summarizers. Projection provenance and
the logical-key catalog are common. Readers accept registered compatible prompt versions; an
agent-name artifact that lacks the later lifetime paragraph renders that field as unavailable.

## Context completeness and frontier metadata

Each optional context channel records a requested count, provided count, and unit. Examples are
`ancestor_transcript` in characters, `prior_days` in summaries, `prior_weeks` in summaries,
`source_occurrences` in occurrences, and `project_overview` in artifacts.

Raw counts with unlike units are never added together. Each channel is converted to a 0–100%
ratio, and the simple `coverage_percent` is the equal-weight average of those channel ratios;
`missing_percent` is its complement. Component-level values remain authoritative so a later policy
can make a better decision than the simple score. A job with no optional context channels is 100%.

Calendar artifacts also record one of:

- `project-start`: no earlier project period was expected;
- `contiguous-extension`: the immediately preceding same-level artifact was available;
- `isolated-backfill`: earlier project time exists but the contiguous predecessor was absent;
- `unknown-legacy`: an older artifact lacks enough provenance to decide.

This metadata permits, but does not itself trigger, policies such as “regenerate only when context
coverage improves from 50% to at least 80%.” Automatic resummarization remains opt-in because it
spends tokens.

## Version compatibility policy

- A prompt or model-visible instruction change increments the registered summarizer version and
  prompt-version string, with a changelog entry.
- An additive output field increments the output schema version. Readers must accept older schemas
  and represent absent fields as unavailable.
- A semantic change to an existing field requires a summarizer-version bump even when JSON shape
  is unchanged.
- Old immutable artifacts and receipts are retained. A targeted run may upgrade only one hour or
  day; neighboring older versions remain valid inputs when their fields satisfy the consuming
  summarizer's declared minimum schema.
- A build never silently treats an incompatible old artifact as current. It reports version and
  context coverage, then degrades to the best compatible artifact or normalized source data.
- Source mutation/truncation and a cache hash mismatch fail closed. Ordinary append-only source
  growth creates new staged inputs only for affected windows/frontiers.
- Provider-specific mutable auxiliary indexes are isolated from authoritative transcript prefixes.
  Orc conversation state may be rewritten only when its complete prior stable-spawn projection is
  proven to remain an unchanged subset. Task-note deletion is retained as a tombstone in the
  cumulative frozen projection; immutable overlap, new-ID high-water, and SQLite sequence guards
  still fail closed on mutation, reuse, or rollback.
- An operator may accept an in-place rewrite of an Orc session's append prefix, and only that: the
  flag is explicit, per invocation and per team, and it never covers a row leaving or entering the
  prefix. Acceptance re-baselines the digest, keeps every record, names the changed rows and
  columns in both the terminal and the run receipt, and marks the source degraded permanently. The
  refusal that recommends the flag discloses its price, and the run that accepts it retains the
  superseded snapshot object rather than collecting it, so the summary it records is never the only
  surviving account of the change.
- A durable artifact is retired only when it holds nothing the archive does not still hold, and it
  is then removed rather than left to rot, in the namespace that wrote it. Ingest removes
  `teams/<slug>/raw/messages/<thread-id>.json`, a per-thread re-serialization of `raw/team.json`
  that no version of any reader ever opened; the sweep runs after `raw/team.json` is durable, takes
  every regular file directly inside that ingest-owned directory whose name has the writer's shape
  — `<archive-id>.json`, including orphans from an earlier wider ingest and, deliberately, anything
  else left there under that name — leaves a symlink, a subdirectory and every other name alone
  along with the directory containing them, and reports the reclaimed file and byte counts in the
  run receipt.
  The build sweepers cannot do this job: they are structurally unable to name a path under `raw/`,
  which is what stops a presentation bug from deleting ingest data.

### Retiring a durable artifact

Retirement is a removal, not an abandonment, and it happens in three places at once: the writer
goes, the namespace that owned the writer sweeps what it wrote, and the layout documentation stops
listing the path. The tempting alternative — delete the writer and leave the bytes for someone
else, or for a garbage-collection command nobody runs — is the worst of the available options. An
archive is meant to be version controlled, so a file the tool has stopped maintaining keeps being
cloned and diffed while reading as current.

The precondition is evidentiary, not aesthetic: retirement requires showing that no reader exists
*and* that nothing is lost. `render.prune_retired_query_artifacts` establishes the first by byte
equality with the generated launcher, and refuses to touch a file it cannot recognize. The
`raw/messages/` sweep establishes the first by the absence of any path join naming that directory
anywhere in this repository's history, and the second by the projection being recomputable from
`raw/team.json`, which sits beside it and is written first. Both follow the same discipline: never
a symlink, never outside the namespace that wrote the artifact, and idempotent, so an interrupted
sweep costs one repeat rather than a torn archive.

The two differ in how tightly they can recognize their own output, and the difference is forced,
not stylistic. The retired launcher had exactly one possible content, so byte equality is available
and is used. A per-thread projection's bytes depend on the thread, so there is nothing fixed to
compare against, and the strongest exact rule available — the thread ids in the current
`raw/team.json` — is not merely weaker but wrong: it would strand the orphans an earlier wider
ingest left behind, and by keeping the directory non-empty forever it would prevent the removal it
exists to perform. The sweep therefore matches the writer's name shape inside a directory that
belongs to ingest, and the guide says so rather than promising an exactness the code does not have.

## Required time/backfill behavior

The durable archive must support independent summary selection from ingestion range. In particular:

- Generate or backfill one exact hour, day, or arbitrary half-open interval without buying every
  later summary. `--summary-start-time`, `--summary-end-time`, and repeatable `--rollup-kind`
  control this independently from normalized ingestion.
- Record whether each calendar result extended a contiguous frontier or was isolated.
- Load sparse prior hour/day/week artifacts when available and record missing slots when absent.
- Sweep left-to-right later to improve context without making that sweep a prerequisite for a
  useful partial archive.
- Export one website slice into a separate package without truncating or changing durable
  normalized data or cached artifacts.

The proving target is all three teams from `2026-08-07T02:00:00Z` through
`2026-08-07T11:00:00Z` (22:00 Aug. 6 through 07:00 Aug. 7 EDT). The first paid proving run is only
the first hour and uses `gpt-5.5` at `medium` reasoning effort; provider failure must be reported
rather than silently falling back to another model or backend.
