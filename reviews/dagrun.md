# dagrun and cpuset-alloc adversarial review

## Scope

Reviewed both package implementations of `dagrun` and `cpuset-alloc`, with emphasis
on tree-wide CPU containment, the shared reservation ledger, CLI failure behavior, stress-mode
sizing, standalone package documentation, and live cross-implementation interoperability.

This review record entered the repository with implementation commit
`5ef91c55036227b5dc2997ef069784f337b4cc5e`.

## Adversarial findings and resolutions

1. **Process affinity was not tree containment.** A wrapped child could call
   `sched_setaffinity` and move from its reserved CPU to another allowed CPU while both wrappers
   still returned success. Both implementations now require an exact cgroup
   `cpuset.cpus.effective` bound and fail closed when it is unavailable. There is no soft-affinity
   fallback.
2. **Reservation exhaustion could fall back to a colliding picker.** Occupying every allowed core
   in the live ledger still allowed `run --cores` to start. Exhaustion now returns operational
   status 3 without launching the DAG or wrapped command.
3. **The hard-pin probe admitted false positives.** The old probe did not require a real escape
   mutation and accepted partial positive coverage. The replacement directly attempts to move a
   live child to an excluded CPU, requires that mutation to be blocked without changing the
   child's allowed set, proves every assigned CPU individually usable, and proves exact affinity
   restoration. Probe subprocesses have bounded timeouts.
4. **Same-sized cpusets were treated as equivalent.** Verification compared cardinality rather
   than CPU identity. It now parses Linux CPU-list syntax and requires exact set equality.
5. **An ambient user scope could be mutated.** Core boxing now changes only a verified runner-owned
   scope or direct managed cgroup. An unrelated ambient `.scope` is never modified.
6. **One release could delete another live reservation.** Two same-process, same-tag reservations
   shared an incomplete identity. Release now matches `(pid, starttime, tag, cores)`, with
   regression tests in both implementations.
7. **CLI edge cases diverged.** Non-positive core counts, negative/non-finite sampling windows,
   missing separators, selftest-only options, wrapped `--help`, missing executables, and
   signal-terminated commands now have tested, clean behavior. Signals use shell status
   `128 + signal`; missing executables return status 3 without a traceback or panic.
8. **Stress parity had two faults.** The differential compared nondeterministic parallel trace
   order, and the Rust stress footprint used a one-byte floor while the Python package used the
   configured default step floor. The comparison now checks the stable report block, and both
   implementations apply the same conservative footprint floor with saturating summation.
9. **Package-facing documentation exposed implementation provenance.** Installed guides,
   module-level documentation, public docstrings/rustdoc, and quickstarts are now standalone.
   The package checks reject sibling-language, unrelated-project, repository-path, and template
   leakage. The Rust crate archive also includes its license.
10. **Nested summary help advertised the wrong action.** Rust intercepted every
    `summary <action> --help` request with the generic summary page, hiding real plan flags and
    showing unrelated build flags. Both engines now expose action-specific build, merge, plan, and
    stats contracts; the differential requires the right flags and rejects cross-action leakage.
11. **Summary action schemas were displayed but not enforced.** Rust discarded unexpected
    positionals and silently defaulted malformed reservoir caps, planner names, and output formats.
    Both editions now enforce the same positive signed-64 ASCII cap grammar and action arity, reject
    missing or invalid values, preserve `--` and empty-assignment behavior, and describe planning
    from summary JSON plus a DAG. Adversarial differentials exercise every failure and edge case.
12. **Teardown behavior had diverged and could be bypassed.** One implementation granted a bounded
    SIGTERM diagnostic window while the other immediately killed; the latter also invoked an
    unqualified `kill` from caller-controlled `PATH`. Teardown now uses direct `kill(2)`, gives the
    same bounded grace once per cancellation batch, ignores zombie leaders when deciding whether a
    cooperative child exited, and escalates. Cgroup boxing is the robust whole-subtree boundary;
    unboxed process-group, parentage, and ownership-nonce sweeps additionally remove ordinary
    environment-preserving setsid/double-fork escapees, but cannot promise containment against a
    child that scrubs its environment. The differential proves the explicit fixture PID is gone
    and its TERM attribution marker survives. The libraries no longer make the host process a
    permanent child subreaper as a hidden side effect.
13. **A child could silently miss its cgroup.** The shell migration wrote `cgroup.procs` with
    `|| true`, so a step could run outside applied limits while cleanup of an empty cgroup appeared
    successful. Migration now fails closed with a distinct pre-command status. Cgroup names use an
    injective byte encoding, preventing two valid DAG tags from sharing a containment directory;
    an encoded name beyond the filesystem component limit is rejected before the user command.
14. **IRQ-budget placement could certify missing samples.** Counter rollback, CPU hotplug between
    snapshots, an unreadable first snapshot, missing per-core IRQ data, and a zero sampling window
    produced exceptions or false zero rates. Both allocators now require a positive finite window
    when a budget is requested, use only successfully measured cores, and reject missing or rolled
    back counters. The self-test forwards the configured IRQ budget instead of silently dropping it.
15. **Default evidence exposed logs and grew without a paired contract.** The native-only `/tmp`
    journal was default-on, permissively created, and unbounded. Both packages now implement the
    same explicit opt-in journal, private per-step raw logs, conservative test-boundary parser, and
    timeout culprit report. Directories and files must be owned private objects; no-follow,
    nonblocking, single-link validation rejects symlinks, hard links, FIFOs, and overlong names.
16. **Malformed reservation state could silently release or rename ownership.** Rust dropped bad
    core entries, truncated oversized PIDs, and coerced tags/timestamps while Python applied a
    different set of coercions and defaults. Both now require the same complete typed record:
    positive bounded PID/starttime, a nonempty unique bounded integer core list, a string tag, and
    a finite non-negative numeric timestamp. Invalid ledgers fail closed without being rewritten.
17. **One `-j` number conflated DAG-node fan-out with total CPU capacity.** A graph could limit
    itself to two active nodes only by also pretending each node had one unit of internal
    parallelism. `run -s/--max-steps` now bounds active DAG nodes, while
    `run -j/--max-cpus` sets the boxed run's shared CPU-bandwidth budget and the maximum width of
    any one runner-controlled step. `--max-mem` derives the step ceiling, and CPA receives the
    explicit per-step/allocation budget. The ambiguous 0.13 long spelling
    `run --jobs` remains only as a hidden compatibility alias and disagreement with the canonical
    option is rejected; `sweep --jobs` remains the public per-step width-range option.
18. **CPU quota was at risk of being described as instantaneous core containment.** `cpu.weight`
    is priority, not a cap, and cgroup `cpu.max` is a period-based bandwidth limit that permits
    short multi-CPU bursts. The implementation now exact-reads the outer run's `cpu.max`; the
    documentation and tests distinguish long-window bandwidth from CPU identity. Exact eligible
    CPUs remain the separate `--cores K` cpuset contract.
19. **Authored widths could exceed the run budget or disappear behind defaults.** Both schedulers
    now visibly cap a step's preferred width, appended jobs flag, per-step `cpu.max`, and the
    undeclared-step CPU default to total budget `P`. CPA uses that effective default, and a speedup
    curve with no point at or below `P` cannot authorize a wider allocation.
20. **A union of sampled CPU IDs was not a concurrency measurement.** The shared fork-based guest
    records step/worker lifetimes, process CPU time, current CPU, and run-scope `cpu.stat`. Exact
    overlap checks allow A/B to C/D migration across time; a boxed adversarial case deliberately
    runs more than `P` workers while proving the verified `P`-core bandwidth envelope instead of
    relabelling migration or a legal quota burst as failure.
21. **A compatibility wrapper silently collapsed Rust sweep widths.** `sweep --jobs 1..N` set the
    step's preferred width but invoked the combined-limit wrapper with `P=1`, so every Rust sample
    above one was actually run at one. The sweep now calls the independent-limit API, and the
    differential records the guest's received `--workers=N` arguments instead of trusting table
    labels.
22. **Process-creation failures could strand scheduler state or defeat fail-fast.** Python let
    `OSError`/`ValueError` escape a supervisor thread, leaving the tag and CPU/resource reservations
    live forever; both engines could also miss a sibling admitted before its PID registration.
    Spawn errors now become typed failed outcomes, clean their prepared cgroup, mark every admitted
    peer aborted, and make a late-registering peer self-reap. The cross case uses an embedded-NUL
    environment value and a ten-second sibling to prove prompt eager cancellation without a
    traceback.
23. **Default-capped profile rows claimed the wrong width.** A boxed undeclared step ran under the
    one-core default `cpu.max` but was persisted at the ambient machine width, corrupting speedup
    buckets and omitting quota utilization. Both engines now record the applied default only when
    boxing is active, with a one-core denominator; explicitly unboxed runs retain the shared
    identity-derived ambient width rather than claiming enforcement that did not occur.
24. **Ordering planners could recommend widths above the run budget.** CPA bounded its learned
    speedup curves to `P`, but greedy-LPT and critical-path `--show-plan` could still advertise a
    profile-derived width larger than `--max-cpus`, even though execution later clamped it. Every
    run planner now receives the same resolved `P`; recommendations and regression markers are
    bounded while wider measurements remain visible as diagnostic curve points.
25. **An empty `jobs_flag` made command-width capping fictitious.** The runner rewrote
    `preferred_inner_jobs=32` to 16 and labeled the profile/memory model as width 16 even though a
    self-managed command could still execute a hardcoded `-j32`. Such a positive declared fixed
    width is now left unchanged and refused before any DAG step process when it exceeds `P`
    (file-backed runs reject before cgroup setup; stdin may already be inside the outer scope).
    Pure CPA planning preserves the impossible fixed width, publishes no executable allocation for
    it, and reports `infeasible-fixed-width` rather than laundering it through plan application.
    The low-level allocator raises/returns a typed `InfeasibleAllocationError`; that Rust API
    change is released as 0.15. `sweep --jobs` refuses self-managed steps because it cannot vary
    the guest. Empty and whitespace-only flags share exactly this behavior and never append a bare
    positional width. Arbitrary undeclared threads remain bounded only by CPU bandwidth, not thread
    count.
26. **Diagnostic curves and skipped nodes polluted CPA truth.** A self-managed curve was labeled as
    the duration source even when CPA actually used a scalar hint, and an intentional skip still
    consumed critical-path, CPU-area, and memory budget despite never spawning. Fixed commands now
    use an exact measured level only when their declared width exists in the curve; otherwise the
    scalar source remains authoritative. Intentional skips have zero executable planning demand,
    are excluded from memory/stress accounting, retain their authored hints when a plan is applied,
    and cannot suppress widths for runnable work. Nonpositive library-authored widths consistently
    fall through to the positive per-step default in both implementations.
27. **Declared inner widths were incorrectly treated as additive CPU reservations.** The ready-set
    scheduler refused to overlap legal steps when their requested widths summed above `P`, even
    though the boxed parent already enforces aggregate `cpu.max=P` and beneficial oversubscription
    is workload-dependent. Both implementations now let `--max-steps`, dependencies, and named
    resources govern overlap while retaining the individual `p_i <= P` clamp/refusal and the exact
    outer bandwidth boundary. Width-aware `--max-mem` sizing and per-step `memory.max` now use the
    same applied width, so removing the implicit serialization does not undercount modeled RAM.
    Adversarial cross tests run multiple width-`P` steps concurrently and prove their aggregate
    requested width can exceed `P` while the outer long-window CPU envelope remains within `P`.
    No current planner claims to optimize this oversubscription: greedy-LPT and critical-path only
    order work, while CPA's area and makespan values are explicitly a no-overcommit planning
    reference derived from isolated per-step curves, not a prediction of the live contended run.
28. **Removing implicit CPU serialization exposed unsafe and divergent memory assumptions.** The
    ordinary `--max-mem`, CPA, runtime cgroup, and stress paths disagreed about effective width;
    hard-cap-only, default-capped, and selected `engine_only` work could disappear; learned RSS was
    applied only after CPA allocation; an impossible one-step budget was reported as runnable; and
    signed-64 overflow could panic Rust while Python continued with a different value. All paths
    now share width-aware caps, floor/safety-factor handling, saturating arithmetic, and an explicit
    unbounded sentinel. CPA uses learned RSS before allocation and reports `infeasible-memory`
    without executable widths; `jobs_for_budget` returns a zero-step sentinel and the CLI refuses.
    Aggregate memory then tightens (never loosens) the explicit-or-default active-step ceiling.
    Stress checks both the CPU-capped authored graph and the final expanded post-feedback graph,
    retains a per-copy control-plane floor, and refuses expansions above 100,000 generated nodes.
    Exact subset search is bounded; wide graphs use a conservative largest-caps fallback before
    dependency closure, and dependency traversal itself is iterative with an O(n) one-step path.

## Cross-implementation evidence

- `python3 cross/differential.py --tool cpuset-alloc`
  - **58/58 checks passed**.
  - Includes Python-to-Rust and Rust-to-Python live ownership of one shared ledger, disjoint core
    assignments under overlap, identical shared schema, exact release to an empty ledger, mutation
    self-test verdicts, signal status, invalid inputs, wrapped help, and clean missing-executable
    failure, plus 23 malformed-record variants that both refuse without rewriting shared state.
- `python3 cross/differential.py --tool dagrun`
  - Default seed/count completed with **489 checks passed across 42 fixtures**.
  - Includes `S`-governed overlap, per-step `P` clamping, deliberate width oversubscription,
    migration-safe worker overlap, guest-observed sweep widths, spawn-failure eager cancellation,
    profile-width parity, fail-closed memory/stress cases, and capability-gated live
    outer-`cpu.max` bandwidth evidence.
- `python3 -m mypy cross/differential.py`
  - No issues.

The differential launches compared CLIs in independent sessions/process groups. This prevents an
adversarial CLI or scope manager from taking down the comparison harness and makes signal behavior
an observed result rather than a harness-level side effect.

## Profile-feedback audit

The independently reviewed [profile feedback and modeling audit](../ai_docs/dagrun-profile-feedback-audit.md)
separates collection, model selection, and execution impact. It confirms that Hermit and DeepScry
currently collect profile evidence without closing the automated feedback loop, and records the
portable-summary sampling blocker, provenance gaps, memory-model mismatches, and consumer-specific
evidence without treating a source label as proof that runtime behavior changed.

## Focused test evidence

- Python: the full repository package run reached **1,744 passed**; the remaining five cases were
  blocked by this host's BPF-jailer from executing `git`, and all five passed on immediate isolated
  rerun. All **1,749 collected tests** are therefore accounted for without treating a host security
  denial as a product verdict.
- Rust: the full safe package suite passed **187 unit tests plus 27 integration tests**, including
  termination attribution, live cgroup memory, CPU-time, core-box, run-timeout, and containment
  tests.
- `python3 scripts/embed_userguides.py --check`: all 16 paired documents and 6 single-language
  documents are current and standalone through 32 exact checked package links.
- Isolated wheel/crate artifact checks passed for all packages, including entry points, embedded
  resources, licenses, offline startup, and foreign-documentation checks.

## Capability boundary

Hard CPU pinning intentionally requires a working user systemd scope with `AllowedCPUs`. On hosts
without that capability, both packages reserve nothing permanently, launch no workload, explain
the missing hard boundary, and return status 3. This is a refusal, not silent degradation.
