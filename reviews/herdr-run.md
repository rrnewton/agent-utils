# herdr-run paired-port adversarial review — 2026-08-06

Independent implementation and security reviews challenged the Python and Rust packages after the
initial port. The review covered command admission, executable provenance, Herdr protocol
narrowing, workspace/tab lifecycle, concurrency, readiness, byte capture, audit behavior,
configuration parsing, package isolation, and installer-facing documentation.

## Outcome

The review found security-relevant overclaims and destructive edge cases that made the initial
port unsuitable to publish. Most importantly, default `cargo fetch` was not a no-code-execution
capability: Cargo can invoke repository-configured compiler wrappers even for dependency-oriented
commands. Cargo was removed from the default allowlist and retained only as an explicitly trusted,
fail-closed project widening. The package now accurately describes its allowlist as a cooperative
safety rail rather than a security boundary against another process running as the same user. All
high-priority findings below were fixed in both implementations before this report was accepted.

## Findings resolved

- Project-local pane locks were replaced by an account-global namespace rooted at the current
  account database home. Both ports derive the same lowercase SHA-256 pane lock name, so callers
  from different projects serialize against the same Herdr pane.
- Workspace/tab discovery and creation now run under one account-global resolution lock and repeat
  live lookup while holding it. Concurrent first runs cannot create duplicate labels.
- Tool-created spool, cache, run, and lock directories use `0700`; command, output, metadata,
  cache, and lock files use `0600`. A pre-existing configured spool directory is never chmoded,
  including `spool_dir: .`, and final audit/spool symlinks are not followed. The shell wrapper also
  sets `umask 077`.
- Every Herdr/systemd control subprocess has a 30-second bound. Both process transports launch a
  fresh process group and kill the group on timeout; Python reaps and drains its direct child, and
  Rust drains both pipes concurrently before reaping. Invalid subprocess bytes are decoded with
  replacement in both ports.
- Command/readiness timeouts have one shared one-year maximum at configuration, CLI, and public
  library boundaries. NaN, infinity, negative, and huge finite values can no longer become an
  infinite wait or differ between ports. A timeout preserves partial output and the spool path.
- Configuration parsing is strict YAML 1.2 core behavior in both ports: duplicate/merge/custom-tag
  inputs, wrong shapes, non-finite and excessive numbers, control characters, surrogates, invalid
  UTF-8, and unknown keys fail as typed configuration errors without a traceback or panic.
- Protocol responses require the documented list/object/string/integer shapes. Process IDs must be
  positive 32-bit `pid_t` values, embedded-NUL identifiers become typed failures, pane identity and
  pane/tab/workspace relationships are checked, duplicate labels fail closed, and cached ids are
  revalidated through unique live label resolution. Corrupt or invalid-UTF-8 caches are ignored.
- Executable selection ignores caller `PATH` and `HOME`, uses the same fixed candidate order in both
  ports, canonicalizes each candidate, and rejects group/world-writable executables. The same
  validation applies to `systemd-run`.
- CLI differences found by review were pinned and removed: Python option abbreviations are off,
  Rust stops interpreting options after `--`, option values cannot be stolen by help/version,
  loose command words are refused rather than silently rejoined, explicit-agent wrapper words are
  preserved, environment-derived agent names are trimmed, and the default command directory is
  the caller's current directory. CWD and doctor failures now have matching typed/audited outcomes.
- Raw mode emits each immutable captured byte stream once. JSON mode supplies both
  replacement-decoded text and byte-exact base64. Spool-read and output-write failures are typed;
  metadata failure after completion warns and yields `"meta": null` instead of hiding the
  command's output or status.
- Audit append failure is visible but best effort. The audit file is opened no-follow and an
  existing parent is never chmoded. A normal execution records admission before target
  resolution/launch and a final outcome afterward; refusals, dry runs, wrapper failures, and doctor
  probes are represented. Documentation no longer claims durable or tamper-proof logging.
- Retention prunes only a completed run with a regular, parseable `exit_code`, aged from that
  marker's mtime. Active/timed-out runs, FIFO or symlink markers, unsafe root/ancestor symlinks,
  invalid negative/huge windows, siblings, and loose files fail closed toward preserving evidence.
- Cargo is not allowed by default. An explicit project opt-in must retain a positive Cargo
  subcommand list; the minimum `--config`/`-Z` injection guards cannot be removed by replacing a
  policy map, and attached or post-subcommand forms are refused. Documentation states that even an
  admitted fetch may execute ambient helpers and is therefore a deliberate trust widening.
- The fake Herdr implementation moved out of the Python distribution into tests. Python and Rust
  package artifacts contain only their own implementation and standalone language-specific docs.

## Executable evidence

The black-box differential currently exercises 105 paired cases covering startup/help/version and
argument parsing, command tokenization/rendering and policy refusal, successful and malformed
configuration, option placement, dry-run JSON/text output, audit JSONL, control-character classes,
Unicode, Cargo opt-in guards, and stable exit behavior. The repository contract runs it through
`make cross`.

Lifecycle behavior is also pinned independently in both unit suites: account-global first-create
and pane-lock concurrency, cache validation, split-pane refusal, readiness, control-process timeout,
private filesystem modes, byte capture, collision-safe spools, and metadata/audit degradation.
Package checks build and install each wheel/sdist and crate archive in isolation before exercising
its installed command and embedded guide. The focused completion run passed 311 Python cases, 86
Rust tests, strict Clippy, and all 105 paired differential cases.

## Deliberate limitations

The differential does not inject a fake executable through `PATH`: production resolution rejects
that override by design, and a test hook in the shipped command would weaken the provenance rule it
is meant to test. Therefore live Herdr lifecycle/protocol/concurrency parity is evidenced by
corresponding deterministic unit scenarios, not by the 105 black-box cases. A future external test
environment with an isolated account and real Herdr server can add end-to-end differential coverage
without adding a production bypass.

The default `git` and `gh` policy still grants the capabilities of those programs, including
repository hooks and ambient user configuration. Targeted deny rules remove common escape hatches,
but they are defense in depth rather than a positive capability model. Projects should narrow
`allow` and the deny maps for their use case.

Audit records are private operational evidence, not durable security logs: they are not fsynced,
replicated, immutable, or protected from the same UID. Enforceable policy and audit require a
separate broker plus sandbox rules that deny direct Herdr and user-systemd access.
