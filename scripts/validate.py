"""Run the checks this change actually needs, and say what was skipped and why.

The portable, current-toolchain repository contract is expensive. A full run builds and tests all
workspace code, runs the cross-language differential over every paired tool, and then packages and
smoke-installs eight distributions and seven crates. That is the right price for a broad or
unclassified change. It is the wrong price for a change to an independent tool or to
repository-only prose: checks that cannot observe the edit only make the author wait.

So this maps changed paths onto the checks that could plausibly go red because of them and reports
the plan by name. Broad groups say RUN or skip; when component labels select only part of a broad
group, the report says narrow rather than falsely claiming that group cannot observe the edit.
A selector that quietly does less is indistinguishable from one that is broken, so expected work
is always reported explicitly rather than dropped in silence.

Two safety properties, both tested in `--self-test`:

* **An unrecognised path selects EVERYTHING.** Adding a new top-level directory must not silently
  opt out of validation. Unknown means unknown, and unknown means run the lot.
* **`--all` is always available**, and is what the nightly portable-contract path should use.
  Selection is a convenience for the edit-run loop, not a new definition of "validated".

Usage:
    python3 scripts/validate.py                 # against origin/main
    python3 scripts/validate.py --base HEAD~1
    python3 scripts/validate.py --all           # the entire portable contract, no selection
    python3 scripts/validate.py --list          # print the plan, run nothing
    python3 scripts/validate.py --self-test     # check the mapping itself, offline

HOST SETTINGS. A host may need to tell the graph which npm binary to run, a package registry
mirror, or a Node release mirror -- facts about the machine that the repository must not name.
They go in ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/agent-utils/validate.env, one KEY=VALUE per line ('#'
comments and blank lines allowed, VALUE taken literally), and only these keys are accepted:
AGENT_UTILS_NPM, AGENT_UTILS_NODE_DIST_URL, npm_config_registry. Any other key, a malformed or
repeated line, or an empty value stops validation before it starts. The values reach the
validation graph's environment and nothing else; a variable already set in the caller's
environment wins. Each run prints the file and the keys it set, never their values.
