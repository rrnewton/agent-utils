"""Reject the names of projects that CONSUME this repository.

`agent-utils` is a reusable collection of libraries. Other repositories submodule it and use it;
they are its clients, not its subject. A reader who has never heard of a client must be able to
read this tree end to end without meeting a name they cannot resolve, and without having to work
out whether it is a dependency, a fork, or a place they are supposed to have access to.

Three narrower guards already forbade these names, but only inside PACKAGED OUTPUT -- rendered
user guides and the docstrings that ship in a wheel or a crate. That left most of the tree
uncovered, and the paths where the names actually accumulated -- `ai_docs/`, `reviews/`, dated
design records -- are exactly the ones `scripts/validate.py` maps to no checks at all. This scans
every tracked text file instead, so there is nowhere left for a client name to sit unobserved.

Two safety properties, both covered by `--self-test`:

* **An exemption must still be earned.** Every allowlisted path has to exist AND still contain a
  match. An exemption that has outlived its reason is a failure, not a quiet no-op, so the
  allowlist cannot grow into a second place where these names are tolerated.
* **Ordinary English is not a violation.** The pattern is anchored so that `thermite` and
  `hermitage` pass while `dev-hermit` and `DeepScryCoder1` do not.

See `#86 scrub-client-names`.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_client_names.py
    python3 scripts/check_client_names.py --self-test

#: The client projects, case-insensitively, so `deepscry-bot`, `DeepScryCoder1` and `dev-hermit`
#: are all caught while `thermite` and `hermitage` are not.
#:
#: The trailing guard is `[sS]?(?![a-z])` rather than a plain `\b`, because `\b` does not sit
#: between `y` and `C`: `\bDeepScry\b` misses `DeepScryCoder1` entirely, and a name glued to a
#: CamelCase suffix is exactly how one survived in a test fixture. Refusing only a LOWERCASE
#: continuation keeps `hermitage` out while still catching a CamelCase or hyphenated compound,
#: and the optional `s` keeps the plural.
#:
#: The case-fold is SCOPED to the name with `(?i:...)` instead of being a flag on the whole
#: pattern. Under a global `re.IGNORECASE` the lookahead `[a-z]` also matches `A-Z`, which turns
#: "not followed by a lowercase letter" into "not followed by a letter" and silently reinstates
#: the CamelCase hole this trailing guard exists to close.
