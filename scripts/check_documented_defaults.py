"""Pin documented shell-executor and agent-control numeric defaults to their code constants.

The guides are shipped artifacts: `py/agentctl/USER_GUIDE.md` is embedded into the agent-control
crate and included in the wheel, the chat bridge guide `rs/agentctl/src/embedded_chat_userguide.md`
is compiled into the same crate, the shell guides go inside both distributions, and
`CONFIG_TEMPLATE.yaml` is what `herdr-run init` writes into a project. Agents read those documents
as fact. Until this guard existed, "up to `--ready-timeout` (900 seconds by default)" was held true
by nothing at all: the constant lives in several places across two implementations, and changing them
left the sentence quietly asserting the old number.

**This is not a self-fulfilling test.** The repository has repeatedly written checks that read a
constant, format the very sentence they then compare against, and pass whatever the constant is.
The comparison here is between two SEPARATE artifacts: a number parsed out of prose that nothing
generated, and a number parsed out of the source that defines it. Neither side is derived from the
other, and `--self-test` proves it the only way that means anything — by mutating each code
constant in memory and requiring this check to go red and name the document.

What is pinned, and the rule for each:

* A pin's CODE sites must all agree. `ready_timeout` is written out in library defaults and both canonical and
  compatibility CLI defaults; an edition that
  changes one of them is a bug before any document is consulted.
* A pin's DOC sites must each match at least once, and EVERY occurrence must equal the code value.
  At-least-once matters as much as the equality: a sentence that is reworded until the pattern
  stops matching would otherwise make this guard silently vacuous, so zero matches is a failure
  that names the file.

Numbers are compared numerically, so `900` in prose, `900.0` in Rust and `900.0` in Python are the
same number, `31,536,000` equals `31_536_000.0`, and a spelled-out `four` equals `4` — the guides
write small counts as words, and that spelling drifts exactly as easily as a digit.

Not covered, deliberately:

* **The other tools' guides.** `dagrun` states numbers in prose too — a two-hundred step ceiling,
  an 85%-of-`MemTotal` budget with an 8 GiB margin. They are real drift candidates and each is one
  more row in `PINS`, but they belong to a different tool and a different survey; this landed with
  `#88 herdr-run-pin-documented-defaults`, which is herdr-run's.
* **Numbers the chat guide derives from the breaker constants.** Its breaker paragraph says a loop
  under the limit can post 480 times an hour, a faster loop trips on its 9th post, one posting
  every 3 seconds trips 24 seconds in, and a tripped loop sends about 96 posts an hour. A pin
  compares one stated number with one constant, so these are not checked. They sit in the same
  paragraph as the pinned numbers they come from, so changing any constant they come from makes
  this guard name lines of that paragraph.
* **Exit codes.** The guides tabulate `75`/`76`/`77`/`78`, but those are a wire contract already
  asserted by the Python and Rust suites and by the cross-language differential, so a change to one
  cannot reach main with the table still standing.
* **The template's NON-numeric defaults** — `workspace`, `spool_dir`, `readiness`, `broker`,
  `probe_remote`, `shells`. `CONFIG_TEMPLATE.yaml` promises those are the tool's values too, and
  they can drift the same way; this guard compares numbers, which is the drift `#88` names, and
  pinning a string wants a second comparison rather than a tenth row.
