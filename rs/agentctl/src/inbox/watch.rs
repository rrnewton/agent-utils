//! `agentctl inbox watch`: observe workers and post inbox notices when their state changes.
//!
//! One sample lists Herdr panes, asks Claude Code for the busy or idle state of each Claude
//! session, and joins the two by process id through `HERDR_PANE_ID` in `/proc/<pid>/environ`.
//! Claude's own state is used for Claude panes because Herdr's screen rules can classify a working
//! Claude pane as idle; when Claude cannot be asked, a Claude pane's state is unknown for that
//! sample rather than taken from the screen. Other panes use Herdr's state, and an idle edge must
//! hold for `--idle-samples` consecutive samples before it is announced.
//!
//! The pure core is [`step`]: previous watch state plus one sample gives the notices to post. The
//! caller adds text (the last assistant message of a Claude transcript since the last notice, or
//! the tail of the terminal) and posts through the inbox, so all coalescing rules apply.
