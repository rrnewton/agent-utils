# agentctl chat — durable event-driven coordinator bridge

`agentctl chat` connects an already registered interactive agent to a chat
subscription plugin. The plugin supplies normalized inbound events through the
provider-neutral `chat-subscription` traits. A separately configured one-shot
command performs replies and reactions. Neither executable obtains authority
from its manifest: the operator chooses routing, sender allowlists, environment
names, and the exact outbound helper path.

The bridge admits each provider batch and its replay cursor durably before it
acknowledges that batch. It writes a bounded `prepared` receipt first, calls the
plugin commit callback, waits for the exact matching `Committed` frame, and only
then atomically replaces that slot with a `committed` receipt containing the
delivery ID, provider sequence, host batch sequence, cursor, event count, and
timestamp. A `prepared` receipt is never reported as confirmed. This artifact
proves that the local plugin callback was released and returned exact protocol
confirmation; it does not prove a later provider network or server-side action.
The bridge then sends the request to the configured named agent.
Replies use the exact `CHAT_REPLY` fence supplied in the prompt and are retained
with one stable outbound UUID before any send attempt. A restart retries the same
operation identity; an unknown transport result is never converted into success.

## Configuration

Create a private owner-only JSON file (normally mode `0600`):

```json
{
  "subscription_plugin": "provider-events",
  "subscription_environment": ["PROVIDER_CERT", "PROVIDER_KEY"],
  "channel_ids": ["spaces/example"],
  "allowed_senders": ["users/owner"],
  "agent_name": "coordinator",
  "agent_label": "codex coordinator",
  "outbound_enabled": true,
  "ack_reaction": "🤖",
  "backend_configuration": {
    "schema": "provider.example/v1",
    "data": {}
  },
  "outbound_command": {
    "executable": "/absolute/path/to/reply-helper",
    "arguments": [],
    "environment": ["PROVIDER_ACCOUNT"],
    "timeout_millis": 30000,
    "shutdown_grace_millis": 2000
  }
}
```

The subscription plugin is discovered below `$AGENTCTL_HOME/plugins` (default
`~/.agentctl/plugins`) using its private manifest. The bridge revalidates and
pins the manifest directory and executable before every generation. Provider
credentials do not belong in the manifest or saved bridge state. When a plugin
needs credential paths or tokens from the service environment, list only their
variable names in `subscription_environment`. Names must be unique shell
identifiers, at most 128 bytes each, with no more than 64 names. Every named
value must be present before the plugin can be launched. The host clears the
plugin environment, restores its small documented non-secret baseline, then
adds exactly these operator-selected names. Values are neither serialized nor
reported by `chat status`; a plugin manifest has no authority to add names.

The outbound helper receives exactly one newline-terminated JSON request and
must emit exactly one newline-terminated JSON response. It is started inside the
same reviewed pidfd/private-process-group supervisor used for subscription
plugins, with a cleared environment plus only the configured names. The host
sets `AGENTCTL_PROCESS_SUPERVISED=1`. The helper must not create another process
group. Its operation deadline is positive and at most 30 seconds. At service
startup the host validates and hashes a native helper of at most 64 MiB, copies
those exact bytes into a sealed in-memory executable, and retains that image for
the generation. Reply and reaction operations neither reopen nor rehash the
source path.

To run intentionally without reactions or replies, set `outbound_enabled` to
`false`, set `ack_reaction` to `null`, and omit `outbound_command`. The delivered
prompt then explicitly identifies the bridge as inbound-only and forbids reply
fences.

## Initialize and run

The named agent must already exist in the selected registry. Every channel in
`channel_ids`, and every thread within it, routes to that one agent. To give
several agents their own conversations, give each agent its own channel, its
own config, and its own bridge state. Two bridges cannot split one shared
channel by thread. Initialization checks the live pane, plugin installation,
outbound executable, and complete configuration before it creates state:

```sh
chmod 600 chat.json
agentctl --registry /work/project/.agentctl chat init \
  --config chat.json \
  --bridge-state /home/me/.local/state/agentctl/project-chat

agentctl --registry /work/project/.agentctl chat run \
  --bridge-state /home/me/.local/state/agentctl/project-chat
```

`run` owns an exclusive state lease. Provider intake blocks on the plugin event
stream; it does not poll a REST listing. Terminal reply capture blocks on
Herdr's `events.subscribe` socket with one bounded generic closing-fence
predicate, then routes the exact reply ID through the in-memory durable-state
index. This supports a maximum-sized provider batch without exceeding Herdr's
predicate limit. Provider notices and SIGINT/SIGTERM interrupt that wait through
a local wake descriptor. A disk-backed terminal and delivery reconciliation
occurs every 300 seconds by default and can be changed with
`--reconcile-interval`.

A provider `Gap` is a terminal loss signal in protocol v1. Its reason does not
contain a recoverable range or completeness proof, so the host journals the
incident, keeps the prior safe cursor, sends no commit, cancels that provider
generation, and exits degraded. `chat status` reports `healthy: false` and the
exact unresolved incident; `chat run` refuses automatic reconnect. Repair needs
a future provider history protocol or an explicit operator procedure—one later
message or checkpoint is not treated as proof that the missing interval was
recovered.

For a bounded manual recovery while the daemon is stopped:

```sh
agentctl --registry /work/project/.agentctl chat tick \
  --bridge-state /home/me/.local/state/agentctl/project-chat
```

Inspecting status is provider- and Herdr-free and does not perform recovery
writes:

```sh
agentctl chat status \
  --bridge-state /home/me/.local/state/agentctl/project-chat
```

Inspect one exact active retained request for latency/audit evidence without a
provider, outbound helper, Herdr call, or state write:

```sh
agentctl chat inspect \
  --bridge-state /home/me/.local/state/agentctl/project-chat \
  --request 64_LOWERCASE_HEX_CHARACTERS
```

The stable output schema is `agentctl-chat-request-inspection/v1`. It contains
the request phase and source IDs; `provenance.host_batch_sequence`,
`provider_sequence`, `delivery_id`, and cursor; `timestamps.admitted_at_millis`,
`delivery_started_at_millis`, `delivered_at_millis`, `ack_started_at_millis`,
and `ack_completed_at_millis`; delivery and acknowledgement receipts; and a
bounded `replies` array with each ordinal, phase, operation ID, provider message
ID, `captured_at_millis`, and `sent_at_millis`. Start timestamps record the first
durable attempt. Delivery, ACK, and reply completion timestamps remain null
after failed or outcome-unknown operations and are written only with positive
Herdr/provider evidence. The command accepts one exact key and reports only an
active retained request. An acceptance harness that later calls `chat close`
must copy and fsync this inspection document first.

An owner or operator can explicitly publish a new root message through the
configured outbound helper without pretending it is a reply:

```sh
agentctl chat publish \
  --bridge-state /home/me/.local/state/agentctl/project-chat \
  --channel-id spaces/example \
  --request-id 123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000 \
  'Please reply to this bridge test.'
```

`publish` accepts `--file PATH` instead of positional text. It requires an
outbound-enabled state and an exact channel from `channel_ids`, validates a
nonempty body of at most 30,000 UTF-8 bytes, and sends `thread_id: null`. The
lowercase RFC 4122 version-4 UUID is caller-owned; an uncertain result may be
retried only with the identical UUID, channel, and body. The command runs the
helper only through the reviewed process supervisor, binds the returned message
resource to the requested channel, and prints the exact v1 success receipt. It
neither writes bridge state nor creates an event-loop reply route; this is an
explicit operator action, not automatic subscription behavior.

Explicitly close reply capture for an old request:

```sh
agentctl chat close \
  --bridge-state /home/me/.local/state/agentctl/project-chat \
  --request 64_LOWERCASE_HEX_CHARACTERS
```

Closure is the provider-neutral terminal route lifecycle; idle/done status and
the first reply do not close a route because a request may send later progress
updates. A closed request remains active until its prompt delivery is confirmed,
its reaction is disabled or confirmed, and every captured reply is sent. It is
also retained while it belongs to the current inclusive replay cursor. Once all
conditions hold and a later cursor is durable, the bridge fsyncs a retirement
journal containing the exact reaction and reply operation/provider receipts,
installs a compact replay and closed-nonce guard, and only then deletes the
active request/reply files. Startup completes an interrupted retirement.

The active population remains capped at 2,048 requests. The compact route and
replay ring retains the latest 4,096 retired identities, matching the pane
marker bound, and the parallel retirement audit ring has 4,096 slots of at most
256 KiB each. Older replay safety relies on the subscription contract's
inclusive monotone cursor; a cursor regression or a reused message identity
with different content fails closed. This is bounded local retention, not a
claim of infinite local audit history.

## Service management

`chat run` is a foreground process and exits cleanly after SIGINT or SIGTERM.
A service manager should restart it on failure and use the same state directory.
Size task and memory limits for the selected provider implementation; those
costs are outside the provider-neutral host and can differ substantially between
plugins. Disable swap for a latency-sensitive bridge only after giving the
provider enough physical-memory headroom.

Derive the hard stop interval from the selected plugin manifest rather than
copying a universal number. Before Hello completes, the host may need
`hello_seconds + close_seconds + shutdown_grace_seconds + 7` seconds. After
Hello, it may need `close_seconds + shutdown_grace_seconds + 7`. The final seven
seconds reserve the process supervisor's two-second forced-reap bound and five
seconds for host reconciliation and worker joins. Start is interruptible after
Hello, so its independent phase timeout is not additive. An admitted reaction
or reply helper separately owns `outbound_command.timeout_millis +
outbound_command.shutdown_grace_millis + 7000` milliseconds. Set
`TimeoutStopSec` to at least the maximum of the applicable provider window and
that outbound window, plus measured service-manager scheduling margin. The
maximum accepted outbound window is 67 seconds. At startup the host pins the
complete selected provider timeout tuple. A later generation whose manifest
differs is rejected until the service restarts, so the configured outer bound
cannot silently become stale.

With systemd 258 or newer, a synchronous same-binary `ExecStop` can address only
the exact main-process identity. `graceful-stop-main` opens a pidfd for
systemd's `MAINPID`, requires its inode to equal `MAINPIDFDID`, sends SIGTERM
through that pidfd, and waits for exact process exit. It does not return at its
70-second diagnostic threshold, because returning would begin a second stop
phase. Pair it with `TimeoutStopFailureMode=kill`: at the one service-manager
deadline, systemd kills the complete control group rather than starting another
grace interval.

For example, a user service can run the same foreground command (replace every
absolute placeholder and tune the resource ceilings from a measured provider
probe):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=agentctl chat bridge
After=herdr.service

[Service]
Type=exec
Environment=AGENTCTL_HOME=/home/USER/.agentctl
ExecStart=/absolute/path/agentctl --registry /work/project/.agentctl chat run --bridge-state /home/USER/.local/state/agentctl/project-chat
ExecStop=/absolute/path/agentctl chat graceful-stop-main --main-pid ${MAINPID} --main-pidfd-id ${MAINPIDFDID}
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=2
KillMode=control-group
OOMPolicy=kill
# Replace every value below with a measured deployment-specific value.
TimeoutStopSec=<DERIVED_SECONDS_WITH_MARGIN>
TimeoutStopFailureMode=kill
TasksMax=<MEASURED_TASKS_WITH_HEADROOM>
MemoryHigh=<MEASURED_RECLAIM_THRESHOLD>
MemoryMax=<MEASURED_HARD_LIMIT>
MemorySwapMax=0
CPUQuota=<MEASURED_CPU_LIMIT>

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

After installing the unit as `agentctl-chat.service`, make persistence explicit
and verify both properties instead of merely starting an ephemeral process:

```sh
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now agentctl-chat.service
systemctl --user is-enabled agentctl-chat.service
systemctl --user is-active agentctl-chat.service
```

`enable --now` survives a user-manager restart; operation while the user is
logged out additionally requires lingering to be enabled for that account.
`Type=exec` makes an `active` transition contingent on successful executable
startup. `KillMode=control-group` and the one derived stop deadline keep plugin
and helper descendants inside the unit's cleanup boundary. Use the same pinned
`agentctl` executable in `ExecStart` and `ExecStop`; a mutable symlink can make
the control helper disagree with the running generation.

The resource tokens in the example are intentionally invalid placeholders, not
defaults, minimums, or evidence about an unmeasured plugin. Measure the whole
service cgroup—including every plugin and helper descendant—under bounded
end-to-end load. Choose limits with explicit headroom, verify their parsed
systemd values after reload, and then prove the selected envelope still meets
the deployment's latency target. A `TasksMax` below a plugin's startup fan-out
will prevent that generation from launching; an excessively loose limit does
not provide useful containment.

The host bounds retained requests, replies, retirement records, commit receipts, per-frame data, event drains,
mailboxes, process cleanup admissions, and helper deadlines. Ordinary provider
or terminal events touch direct durable records. Full directory scans happen at
startup and explicit/periodic recovery, not in the subscription inner loop.
