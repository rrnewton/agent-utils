//! Verified prompt submission for terminal agent composers.
//!
//! A terminal agent accepts a prompt in two separate steps: the text is staged in
//! its composer, and a submission key moves it into the conversation (or into the
//! agent's own queue while it is busy). Sending the key is not proof that the
//! second step happened. An agent can drop a key while it is redrawing or running
//! its own hooks, and the text then stays in the composer indefinitely.
//!
//! [`submit_verified`] drives both steps against the rendered screen and reports
//! one of three outcomes:
//!
//! * nothing was typed ([`Submission::NotStaged`]), so the prompt is safe to retry;
//! * the text left the composer and the screen corroborates a submission
//!   ([`Submission::Verified`]);
//! * an error: either the text is still staged after the deadline (it is left
//!   visible and must never be typed again automatically) or the outcome is
//!   unknown. Callers treat both as possibly submitted.
