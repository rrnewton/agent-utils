//! Reaping policy for stale herdr tabs.
//!
//! Agents are coined and destroyed continuously, and every one that ever ran a command through
//! `herdr-run` leaves a tab behind. This module decides which of those tabs are *provably* finished
//! with, so they can be closed, and -- much more importantly -- which ones must be left alone.
//!
//! # Why the obvious signals do not work
//!
//! Herdr exposes no tab creation time and no last-activity time. `PaneInfo.revision` looks like an
//! activity counter and is not: it counts pane *metadata* revisions and stays put while the
//! terminal produces visible output. So there is no "last used" field to threshold on.
//!
//! Worse, the tempting substitute -- "no output for N minutes" -- cannot work even in principle
//! here. A *finished* agent and a *dead* agent are identical on the silence axis. Any
//! absence-of-output detector conflates them, and the expensive direction of that mistake is
//! killing an agent that is merely thinking.
//!
//! # Why the run-directory PID is the wrong anchor (measured, not assumed)
//!
//! The run spool is `.herdr-run/runs/<utc>-<agent>-<pid>/`, and it is tempting to read that
//! trailing PID as "the process that owns this tab" and treat its death as evidence of staleness.
//! **That PID is the short-lived `herdr-run` CLI invocation, not the agent and not the pane.** It
//! exits the moment the command finishes, so it is dead by construction for every completed run.
//!
//! Measured on the live spool (15 run directories, 2026-08-06): the run-directory PID was dead for
//! **15 of 15**, while the pane shell recorded in the same `meta.json` was alive for **15 of 15**.
//! A policy anchored on the run-directory PID would therefore have classified every tab whose
//! commands had all finished -- which is every healthy idle agent -- as stale.
//!
//! The correct anchor is the **pane's shell process**, which is what actually owns the tab.
//!
//! # The predicate
//!
//! A tab is STALE only when all of these hold, each positive evidence rather than absence:
//!
//! * **R1 no in-flight work.** Every run naming this pane recorded an `exit_code`. A run with no
//!   recorded exit code is IN FLIGHT -- the "agent is thinking" case, positively distinguishable
//!   from a finished one rather than inferred from silence.
//! * **R2 the pane's shell is gone.** Not the run-directory PID; the shell PID.
//! * **R3 reboot and PID reuse are excluded.** `kill(pid, 0)` alone is not sufficient on a busy
//!   host. Identity is bound as `(pid, boot_id, start_ticks)` -- field 22 of `/proc/<pid>/stat` --
//!   and the recorded boot must match the current boot before absence of the old PID can authorize
//!   anything.
//!
//! Anything else -- unreadable `/proc`, missing `meta.json`, absent `pane_id`, a boot-id mismatch,
//! a pane herdr does not know about -- is UNKNOWN, and unknown is never reaped. The cost asymmetry
//! is the whole reason: killing an agent mid-work is far worse than clutter, and a reaper that is
//! wrong once in the expensive direction gets switched off permanently.
//!
//! # Scope is enforced, not trusted
//!
//! Only panes belonging to tabs in *our* workspace, whose labels match the configured tab schema,
//! are even considered. A tab a human opened by hand, or another tool's workspace, is not a
//! candidate no matter how idle it looks.
//!
//! # Report-only by default
//!
//! [`plan_reap`] decides; it never closes anything. Closing is a separate, explicit step. A reaper
//! that is trusted before it has been checked against a known-good population is how the whole
//! workspace gets deleted once.
//!
//! This module holds no I/O. Evidence is passed in (see [`crate::sweep`]), so the policy is
//! testable without a live herdr and without waiting for real processes to die -- and so the
//! planted-stale and planted-live cases can both be exercised deterministically.
