//! Allowlisted, audited command execution through a terminal pane the caller does not own.
//!
//! The pane belongs to a separate terminal server and is not a child of the calling process, so
//! whatever constrains that process does not constrain the command: not its network policy, not
//! its environment, not its lifetime. An agent whose sandbox blocks a destination it legitimately
//! needs is ONE use of that, and the one `herdr-run net-doctor` checks; it is an example, not the
//! definition.
//!
//! The crate exposes the policy and transport layers used by the `herdr-run` command so callers
//! can validate configuration and admission without starting a Herdr session.
