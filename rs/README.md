# agent-utils for Rust

This workspace contains the independently installable Rust editions of the
agent-utils command-line tools. Each crate owns its binaries, library API,
version, license, README, and embedded user guide.

| Crate | Binaries | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `dagrun` | `dagrun`, `cpuset-alloc` | Run and inspect resource-aware CI DAGs; reserve hard-isolated CPU sets for benchmarks. |
| `tick-hub` | `tick-hub` | Evaluate cadenced reminders and health checks in one deterministic tick. |
| `pr-landing-planner` | `pr-landing-planner` | Produce advisory, conflict-aware pull-request landing plans. |
| `herdr-run` | `herdr-run`, `herdr-agent` | Run policy-admitted commands and durably message interactive agents through Herdr panes. |

Install one published command with Cargo:

```sh
cargo install dagrun
cargo install tick-hub
cargo install pr-landing-planner
cargo install herdr-run
```

For workspace development:

```sh
host_target="$(rustc -vV | sed -n 's/^host: //p')"
cargo build --release --workspace --manifest-path rs/Cargo.toml --target "$host_target"
cargo test --release --workspace --manifest-path rs/Cargo.toml --target "$host_target"
cargo clippy --release --workspace --all-targets --manifest-path rs/Cargo.toml \
  --target "$host_target" -- -D warnings
```

The explicit host target shares the cache layout used by the source launchers.

The tracked `rs/bin/<command>` links are source-checkout launchers, not copied
build artifacts. They ask Cargo to validate its incremental workspace cache,
verify and refresh binary provenance, and then replace themselves with the
resulting host-target executable. The target and target directory are explicit,
so ambient Cargo target selection cannot redirect a build away from the binary
that will run. Before execution, the launcher publishes a named,
content-addressed copy outside the deletable Cargo cache; containment code can
therefore safely re-execute its own path while another process cleans or rebuilds.
Direct invocations cannot silently use a binary from older checked-out source.

Cargo and the host-compiler probe run from filesystem root with absolute
workspace and target paths. This prevents a consumer repository that contains
the agent-utils checkout from injecting an enclosing `.cargo/config.toml` or
`rust-toolchain.toml`. Explicit environment choices and the normal user
`CARGO_HOME` configuration remain available. After validation, the utility
itself still starts in the caller's original working directory.

These source-checkout launchers target Linux development hosts and require Git,
Bash 4+, Cargo/Rust, GNU coreutils (`cp`, `readlink`, and `sha256sum`), and
util-linux `flock`. This development path does not affect the portability or
behavior of standalone binaries produced by `cargo install`.

`make clean` removes `rs/target` while holding the launcher lock. It intentionally
retains the content-addressed `rs/.agent-utils-snapshots` cache: an already
running containment command may still need its stable path for re-execution.
Those snapshots are never selected by name or age, only by a freshly verified
binary hash. They may be removed manually when no source-checkout Rust command
is running.

On the first `./setup rs` after upgrading from the former copied-binary layout,
setup removes only the known legacy `rs/bin/<command>.provenance` cache
files. Any other unexpected `rs/bin` entry is reported and refused.

Run `make check-rust-packages` from the repository root to build, inspect, and
smoke the registry archive for each crate independently.
