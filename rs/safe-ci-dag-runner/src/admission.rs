//! Host-wide MEMORY admission: grant, queue, or refuse a run before it contends.
//
// WHAT THIS ADDS THAT `--max-mem` DOES NOT. `sizing::box_mem_budget_bytes` and the `--max-mem`
// refusal in the CLI gate memory at box bring-up: one process, one question, one yes-or-no,
// answered against a snapshot of the host. That has no notion of what OTHER runner invocations on
// the same host have already committed to, so two boxes started a second apart each see the same
// headroom and both take it. Neither is wrong on its own; together they overcommit the machine and
// the symptom is swapping, or an OOM kill in whichever run happens to touch its pages last.
//
// This module is the missing shared state, and it is deliberately the SIBLING of the core ledger
// in `reservation.rs`: a durable, `flock`-serialized file every runner on the host contends on,
// with dead-holder reclaim fingerprinted by `(pid, /proc starttime)` so a crashed run cannot
// subtract memory forever and a recycled PID is never mistaken for the original holder.
//
// THREE ANSWERS, NOT TWO. A yes-or-no can only ever say "no", which tells the caller nothing about
// what to do next: GRANT holds the reservation, QUEUE means waiting can help and says how many
// holders are ahead, REFUSE means waiting can NEVER help and says the number to ask for instead.
// Collapsing QUEUE into REFUSE turns a transient into a permanent failure; collapsing REFUSE into
// QUEUE turns a configuration error into a hang.
//
// TWO CONDITIONS, EACH NAMED SEPARATELY. A grant requires `reserved + requested <= whole-host
// budget` (the condition other RUNNERS affect) AND `requested <= live headroom` (the condition
// NON-RUNNER tenants affect: a ledger cannot see a database that grew). They are kept apart
// because the remedies differ.
//
// The ledger schema, the environment variables, the budget arithmetic and the rendered verdict
// text are shared with the Python distribution byte-for-byte. Change one engine only and
// `cross/differential.py` fails.
