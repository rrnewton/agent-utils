//! Evidence that survives the kill: durable per-step logs and test-level culprit attribution.
//!
//! THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. Two facts about the runner used to combine badly. Captured step output
//! lived only in memory until the step ended, and the per-step profile rows are written at END OF
//! RUN. So the one mechanism that reliably stops a runaway — a hard kill, whether ours or the CI
//! provider's job cancellation — is also the mechanism that destroys every trace of why it was
//! needed. A cancelled GitHub job discards its logs entirely. That is the single largest reason a
//! slow-step regression stayed unexplained for days: the lane could not report on its own failure.
//!
//! The fix is INCREMENTAL EMISSION. Everything here is appended to disk and flushed AS IT HAPPENS,
//! never accumulated for an end-of-run summary:
//!
//! * a per-step `<tag>.log` receiving the step's interleaved stdout/stderr byte-for-byte, and
//! * a run-level `journal.jsonl` of one-line records: step start, each recognized test boundary,
//!   teardown, and the culprit verdict.
//!
//! When the operator configures an evidence directory, kill the runner with SIGKILL at any instant
//! and that directory still describes what was running.
//!
//! TEST-LEVEL ATTRIBUTION. Naming the NODE that hung ("the strict-compat step") is not enough to
//! act on; the actionable fact is WHICH TEST inside that node. [`TestTracker`] derives it from the
//! step's own output stream as the bytes arrive, tracking every test STARTED against its matching
//! completion. On teardown the complete concurrent live set and elapsed time for each survives;
//! the longest-running one is only a likely culprit when several remain.
//!
//! THE UNTERMINATED TAIL IS THE STRONGEST SIGNAL, and it is why the reader here splits lines
//! itself instead of using `read_until(b'\n')`. Rust's libtest prints `test some::name ... ` and
//! then RUNS the test, emitting the verdict on the same line afterwards. A line-oriented reader
//! sees that text only once the test finishes — precisely never, for the test that hung. Reading
//! chunks and keeping the bytes since the last newline leaves the hung test's own start marker
//! sitting in [`StepStream::partial`] at the moment of the kill.
//!
//! WHAT IS RECOGNIZED. Rust libtest, pytest (`-v`), TAP, and an explicit `##TEST-START`/`##TEST-END`
//! protocol any harness can adopt. A pre-signal `/proc` snapshot separately distinguishes CPU-
//! burning from wall-stalled descendants and recognizes nextest's exact libtest argv binding. An
//! unrecognized/shared-process harness degrades honestly: the node and processes are named but no
//! test is, which is strictly better than a guess dressed as attribution.
