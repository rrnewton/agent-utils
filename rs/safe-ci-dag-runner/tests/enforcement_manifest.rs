//! The capability manifest must describe the lane the run is actually on.
//!
//! The manifest used to be one flat object asserting `"cpu_timeout":true`. That sentence is true
//! only under cgroup boxing. On an uncontained lane — `--allow-cgroup-failure`,
//! `--unsafe-no-cgroups`, or a library call with no manager — the CPU guard reads `cpu.stat` zero
//! times, so a step may burn unbounded CPU against a declared budget, exit 0, and be reported
//! green while the manifest says the budget was enforced.
//!
//! The manifest is no longer a literal at all: it is generated from
//! `capabilities::ENFORCEMENT_REGISTRY`, whose entries carry one flag per lane. That is what makes
//! the two columns below checkable AGAINST BEHAVIOUR rather than only against each other — see
//! `enforcement_flag_brackets.rs`, which flips a flag and watches the guard move.
//!
//! The tables below are written out by hand rather than derived from the registry under test: a
//! test parametrised over the value it is meant to protect asserts nothing, and re-serializing the
//! registry would agree with any registry at all. This file is the Rust half of
//! `py/tests/test_enforcement_manifest.py`; `make cross` additionally holds the two engines'
//! manifests byte-identical.
