//! Two-sided bracket for the OUTER run budget and its ordering against the per-step budget.
//!
//! WHY AN OUTER BOUND EXISTS AT ALL. Per-step budgets cannot bound a run: any number of
//! individually-legal steps can sum past any ceiling. Before this, the only thing that stopped
//! such a run was an external job kill — and an external kill discards the very logs that would
//! explain why it was needed. So the bound that fires FIRST has to be one the runner enforces on
//! itself, because that is the only kind that can still write rows and hand back a verdict.
//!
//! THE ORDERING IS THE FEATURE: per-step < in-process run budget < scope `RuntimeMaxSec` < job
//! kill. Each level exists to stop the next one from being the thing that fires.
//!
//! | case                      | asserts |
//! |---------------------------|---------|
//! | `outer_budget_*`          | a run longer than its budget is cut EARLY, reports, and still writes a profile row per step |
//! | `misordered_*` (negative) | a step allowed to outlive the run is REFUSED before anything starts, and named |
//! | `clean_run_*` (control)   | a run inside its budget is untouched: exit 0, no cut, nothing aborted |
//! | `inner_before_outer_*`    | a single slow node dies at ITS OWN bound and the run continues — the inner bound fires first, so the failure is attributable to the node |
