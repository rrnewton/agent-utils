//! Turn persisted per-step profiles into memory-admission estimates, conservatively.
//!
//! The profile store records what each step's cgroup peaked at. It does NOT follow that the peak
//! is what the step wanted: a step whose `peak_bytes` equals the `memory.max` applied to it used
//! everything it was allowed, and a step the kernel killed at that ceiling wanted strictly more.
//! Both are CENSORED observations. Fitting a cap to them re-derives the cap that produced them and
//! freezes the mistake, which is why the default planner feedback in [`crate::estimates`] is left
//! alone and this is a separate, opt-in path a caller must ask for by name.
//!
//! The rules a caller can rely on:
//!
//! * A censored sample never lowers anything. It is used only as a FLOOR — proof that demand was
//!   at least that large — never as an estimate of the maximum.
//! * A row that records a step which FAILED is censored too. A step that did not finish its work
//!   stopped short of where it was going, and `returncode` 137 — SIGKILL — is exactly what an
//!   ancestor-scope OOM kill looks like from inside this reader.
//! * A sample whose censoring cannot be determined (no applied-cap column, no event counters, no
//!   peak) is not evidence at all. It is counted and reported, and never moves the estimate.
//! * With no uncensored evidence no estimate is made, and the reason says how the evidence fell
//!   short. That is a decline, not amnesia: the largest peak the step is proven to have reached
//!   still applies as a floor, so a declined step is modelled at the LARGER of its authored hint
//!   and that floor. "We do not know the peak" and "we know the peak is at least X" are different
//!   states and must not collapse into "we know nothing".
//! * `hard_mem_max_bytes` is never touched. An explicit hard cap is an instruction, not a guess.
//!
//! The columns read here are the ones the writer records per step; see
//! [`crate::perflog::STEP_PROFILE_COLUMNS`].

/// [`MemoryAdmission::proven_floor_bytes`], the largest peak the step is known to have reached,
