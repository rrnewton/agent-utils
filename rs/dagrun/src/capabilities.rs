//! The enforcement manifest, derived from the guards that implement it.
//!
//! The `capabilities` subcommand advertises which containment guards this engine really
//! applies. That manifest used to be a hand-typed JSON string literal, which meant it could claim
//! enforcement that no longer happened: nothing tied the literal to a guard site, so deleting or
//! short-circuiting a guard left the advertisement intact. The py-vs-rs differential compares the
//! two manifests byte-for-byte, which stops the two ENGINES from drifting apart but cannot notice
//! both being wrong together, nor a manifest drifting from the guard sites inside its own engine.
//!
//! So the manifest is generated here instead. [`ENFORCEMENT_REGISTRY`] is the single declaration;
//! [`enforcement_manifest`] serializes it key-sorted, compact and with lowercase booleans, so the
//! two editions agree BY CONSTRUCTION rather than because two people kept two literals in step;
//! and [`is_enforced`] is consulted by the contractual guard. The uncontained `cpu_timeout`
//! fallback is the explicit exception: it may attempt a lower-bound intervention while the
//! published contract remains false because it cannot provide cgroup-equivalent coverage.
//!
//! THE MANIFEST IS PER LANE, BECAUSE ENFORCEMENT IS. Most of these guards are implemented by
//! reading or writing a cgroup, and a run that could not get one (`--allow-cgroup-failure`,
//! `--unsafe-no-cgroups`, or a library call with no manager) does not have them — the step still
//! runs, still exits 0, and is still reported green. A single flat column could only ever describe
//! one of those two worlds, and it described the boxed one, so an uncontained run was advertised
//! guards it was not getting: a step declaring `cpu_timeout: 3` could burn 60 CPU-seconds and be
//! reported green while the manifest said the budget held. Each [`Capability`] therefore carries
//! TWO flags, `contained` and `uncontained`, and [`is_enforced`] takes the [`Lane`] the run is
//! actually on. The lane is not a comment about the guard site; it is the argument the guard site
//! passes. The best-effort uncontained CPU fallback is deliberately outside that Boolean guarantee.
//!
//! [`is_enforced`] panics on an unknown key. A guard site that misspells its capability therefore
//! fails loudly at the moment it runs, rather than reading as "not enforced" and silently
//! switching the guard off — which is the exact failure this module exists to prevent.
//!
//! WHICH KEYS ACTUALLY GATE SOMETHING. Four of the nine are directly load-bearing on both lanes.
//! `cpu_timeout` is load-bearing for exact contained enforcement while an explicitly
//! non-contractual procfs fallback may still act on the uncontained lane:
//!
//! | key             | guard site that consults `is_enforced`                              |
//! |-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `cpu_timeout`   | exact cgroup `cpu.stat`; uncontained fallback is non-contractual       |
//! | `wall_timeout`  | the scheduler's per-step wait deadline                               |
//! | `oom_detection` | the post-step `memory.events` `oom_kill` read                        |
//! | `memory_max`    | the per-step inner `memory.max` write in the cgroup manager          |
//!
//! `pids_guard` gates the per-step `pids.max` write in the companion reference engine, which is
//! the only one with any pids plumbing; this engine has none, which is what `pids_guard: false`
//! says on both lanes. The remaining four — `cpu_affinity`, `cpu_bandwidth`, `run_timeout` and `write_domains`
//! — are declarations only: the registry records them and the manifest publishes them, but no
//! code consults their flag, so flipping one changes the advertisement WITHOUT changing
//! behaviour. Wiring those is a further step, and saying so here is better than implying a
//! coverage that does not exist.
