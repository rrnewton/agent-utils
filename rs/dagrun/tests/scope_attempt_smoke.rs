//!
//! WHAT WENT WRONG WITHOUT THIS. `reexec_in_scope` returned `true` for BOTH "already boxed,
//! proceed" and "policy said skip, we never asked whether boxing was possible", and the caller
//! folded that bool into a single error whose wording, on the skip path, was "boxing was skipped
//! (e.g. CI without a systemd --user scope)". That sentence asserts a cause the code had not
//! tested. Four separate capability probes were then run against it — measuring a branch that
//! never executes in the environment under investigation.
//!
//! THE POLICY IS UNCHANGED HERE and these cases pin that down: every exit code below is what it
//! was before. What changed is that the run now says which of the four things happened, and offers
//! the instrument (`DAGRUN_FORCE_SCOPE_ATTEMPT=1`) to answer the capability question on a runner
//! population nobody has measured.
