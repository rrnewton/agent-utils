//! #98 dagrun-cpu-breach-flake: a CPU breach must be RECORDED in the unit it was measured in.
//!
//! # What is under test
//!
//! The CPU guard compares cgroup `cpu.stat` CPU-seconds against a CPU-second budget, correctly.
//! The RECORD of that decision used to carry an unlabelled `elapsed_s` — which was WALL — beside a
//! `limit_s` that was CPU-seconds. Unlabelled and side by side, the natural reading is that the two
//! are comparable; they are not, and a CPU breach could be quoted as having consumed more seconds
//! than its own run's whole CPU rollup contained.
//!
//! # Why the reading is INJECTED rather than burned
//!
//! The predecessor of this test burned four cores at once and asserted `measured > wall`, on the
//! reasoning that four burners consume CPU faster than wall time passes. That is true on an idle
//! machine and false on a busy one: under a full parallel workspace run the four burners do not
//! each get a core, CPU and wall converge, and the assertion that separates the two quantities
//! stops separating them. It was observed at 2.002 CPU-seconds against 2.004 wall, then passed 3/3
//! in isolation.
//!
//! No margin fixes that. A margin wide enough to survive full load is wide enough to stop catching
//! the regression, because under load the two numbers are genuinely equal — no assertion evaluated
//! at runtime can tell them apart once they are.
//!
//! So the CPU reading comes from the cgroup manager instead of from the scheduler's luck. The
//! guard, the monitor loop, and the record are all the real ones; only the kernel's number is
//! planted, and it is planted FAR from the wall figure the step will have accumulated, so a record
//! that substituted one for the other is visibly wrong rather than coincidentally right.
//!
//! This is what the Python edition already does — see `py/tests/test_termination_evidence_units.py`
//! and the matching `_FAKE_CPU_USED_S` — so the two editions now test this property the same way.
//!
//! # What this does NOT cover, on purpose
//!
//! That a REAL cgroup reading actually crosses a real budget and reaps the step is a different
//! claim, and it keeps its own test: `boxing_cpu_timeout_reaps_a_step_past_its_budget` in
//! `cpu_timeout_smoke.rs` burns for real. It asserts only that a CPU-TIMEOUT happened, never how
//! the two quantities compare, so it has nothing to converge.
