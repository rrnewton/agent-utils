# Description

The Axum graceful-shutdown path waits for long-lived channel SSE responses, so a routine systemd restart remains in stop-sigterm until the 90-second service timeout and the public endpoint returns 502. Make shutdown actively terminate or drain live streams and bound restart downtime without losing persistent state.

# Acceptance Criteria

SIGTERM closes active SSE streams and the process exits within five seconds; a restart keeps the public endpoint outage bounded; an automated test covers the open-stream case.
