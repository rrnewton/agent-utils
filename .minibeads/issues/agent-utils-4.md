# Description

[gpt-5.6-sol] Make the mobile reader installable by Chrome Android while preserving browser-mode fallback for platforms where standalone microphone behavior is risky. Current Chrome diagnostics report manifest-display-not-supported because the manifest deliberately selects browser display.

# Design

Chrome 151 diagnostics report manifest-display-not-supported for display browser. Keep browser as the fallback and add display_override standalone; Chrome Android supports it while current Safari does not. Existing HTTPS, start URL, scope, and 192/512/maskable icons are valid; a service worker is not required for installation.

# Acceptance Criteria

Current Chrome Android reports no manifest display installability error and offers Install app; the chosen manifest fallback remains explicit; tests and operator documentation describe Android and iOS behavior.
