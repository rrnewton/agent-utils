# Description

[opus 5.5] Non-blocking findings from the #229 review: (1) a thread card's reply count lags a live reply by up to a minute while its unread chip updates; (2) a failed refresh of the right column shows nothing (no freshness pill on that side); (3) screen readers hear two nested regions both named Thread; (4) the greyed view picker explains itself only via title on a disabled select; (5) a Main poll in flight when a thread is selected reads that thread twice; (6) no test guards the no-op refresh while the cards are up; (7) dead let sideMark.
