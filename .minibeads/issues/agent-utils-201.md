# Description

[opus 5.5] Found 2026-10-04 while fixing #200 reply-context: for_speech on a 210,000-character line took 142 s in a debug build. strip_inline was quadratic (it copied the rest of the line at every character) and is fixed; another stage (speak_times, name_opaque_strings or collapse_whitespace) is still super-linear. Real messages are capped near 4,000 characters by the providers, so this is low priority, but a stranger's text should not cost the square of its length.
