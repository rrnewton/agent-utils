# Description

[gpt-5.6-sol] Redesign thread selection so a reader can recognize and choose the thread corresponding to the current conversation. Incorporate the pending owner UX specification before implementation.

# Acceptance Criteria

The current conversation is recognizable without opening unrelated threads; selection works on a narrow mobile viewport; state and scroll behavior remain stable; browser tests cover the interaction.

# Notes

Owner UX details were pending when the handoff was requested. Preserve this as a separate task from thread-list correctness.
