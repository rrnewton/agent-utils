# Description

[opus 5.5] devbig014 runs the current vibe-talk build through a runtime systemd override in /run, chosen because the home directory (units, configs, releases) is shared with devbig030. A reboot drops the override and the app falls back to the previous release. Make the devbig014 deployment durable without changing devbig030's.
