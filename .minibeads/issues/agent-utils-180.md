# Description

[opus 5.5] The devbig014 Slack instance polls each channel every 30 s through meta slack.message list. meta slack.message tail (with --catchup oldest) delivered no events for the owner's user token, so push through the ingest route is not possible yet. Find out what subscription the user-token tail needs, then push events (or change-hints) instead of polling.
