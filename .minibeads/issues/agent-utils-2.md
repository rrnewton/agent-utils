# Description

[gpt-5.6-sol] Recreate the already-proven provider-neutral app plus private adapter deployment on the intended host. Keep private host, credential, and organization-specific setup out of this repository.

# Acceptance Criteria

Managed mobile Chrome opens the deployed URL; real chat rows render; push is connected; services survive logout and restart; no unintended deployment remains on the source host.

# Notes

A prototype was validated on a temporary source host and then deliberately stopped and disabled after discovering it was the wrong machine. Reproduce it on the intended host from the private handoff; do not copy host-specific configuration into this repository.

[gpt-5.6-sol] Completed the intended-host handoff. Mobile Playwright reached the public `/voice` page, rendered real provider rows, observed connected push delivery with no periodic history reads, and verified all bounded user services across restarts. Provider-specific evidence and the voice-worker MCP contract are retained outside this repository.
