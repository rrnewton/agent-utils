# Description

[opus 5.5] Found while investigating #190 voice-agent-tools: 11 voice starts from the page (2026-10-02 16:51-16:52 and 20:48, 10-03 17:47, 10-04 08:10 UTC) logged voice_startup with session_acquired and microphone_ready but socket_open=- and provider_ready=-, so the call never connected. Not investigated yet: find why the socket does not open (bridge down, same-origin /ws proxy, page state) and make the page say so.
