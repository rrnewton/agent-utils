# Description

[opus 5.5] Implement the approved recommendation in `ai_docs/transient/2026-09-24-vibe-talk-typescript-shared-types.md` (#140 typescript-shared-types). Rust DTOs stay authoritative; a `contract` module derives `schemars::JsonSchema`; a generator writes deterministic JSON Schema, TypeScript declarations, and standalone Ajv validators that are checked in and verified by a staleness check. `tsc` checks the existing browser script with `allowJs`/`checkJs`/`noEmit` (no bundler, no Wasm), and network/storage boundaries decode `unknown` through the generated validators before the page trusts a value.

# Acceptance Criteria

Generated schema, declarations, and validators are deterministic, checked in, and fail validation when stale; tsc checks the browser script; key HTTP, WebSocket, live-stream, and cached payloads are decoded through generated validators; existing browser, offline-cache, and voice-health behaviour is unchanged; make validate passes and the commit is on public main.
