# Description

[opus 5.5] Owner, 2026-10-08 18:03 CEST: switching the channel view from All to Main flashed a blank screen and ran the fetch/loading animation, although All had already loaded every message and Main only hides thread replies. Wanted: a view switch paints immediately from what the page already holds (All -> Main filters locally; Main -> All shows what is loaded and only fetches what is genuinely missing, without blanking), and never re-fetches cached data or makes the reader wait.
